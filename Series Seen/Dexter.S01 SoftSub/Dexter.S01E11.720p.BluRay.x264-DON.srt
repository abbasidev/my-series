1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,870
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,830
So if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,000
I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,920
Let's face it, Paul.
You've been a problem.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,630
It's time for you to go away.

6
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,590
It's Paul.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,930
He violated Florida's three-strikes law.

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,850
The cops picked him up
totally strung out on heroin.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,640
He's back in jail.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,610
Holy shit! They're fucking fingertips.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,980
He started getting all rough
with me until he saw this.

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,030
Then what?

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,320
Then he changed his tune,
got all turned on.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,490
Told me to take my fake hand off.

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,910
He takes all my nail polish

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,080
and paints each nail a different color.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,160
- Menthol?
- Like cough drops.

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,000
I could hear them clicking
against his teeth when he...

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,290
Son of a bitch loved those lozenges.

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,420
I was confused because I love you.

21
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,380
What did you say?

22
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,130
I love you.

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,720
I love you, too.

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,100
What happened to your lip?

25
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,070
I had an incident with a tool at the workshop.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,990
Just take it easy. I need an
ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,660
A guy's been stabbed.

28
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,910
I've never had much use
for the concept of hell,

29
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,960
but if hell exists, I'm in it.

30
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,470
The same images running
through my head over and over.

31
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,730
I was there.

32
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,480
I saw my mother's death.

33
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,320
A buried memory,
forgotten all these years.

34
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,820
It climbed inside me that day.

35
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,660
And it's been with me ever since -

36
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,120
my dark passenger.

37
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,960
You should be focusing on me, socio.

38
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,140
Seriously want to get
the motherfucker that did it to Batista.

39
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,770
Hey. You all right?

40
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,690
Yeah. I'm OK.

41
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm just, you know, distraught about Angel.

42
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,820
- How's he doing? Do we know?
- Still in surgery.

43
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,660
LaGuerta's there.

44
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,620
God, I hate feeling so helpless.

45
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,500
What, no jokes about providing
gross sexual comfort at a time of crisis?

46
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,580
Our friend was stabbed...

47
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,500
and he might die.

48
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,090
Officer Morgan.

49
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,970
What do you think, Dex?

50
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,310
He put up a fight. There was a struggle.

51
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,310
Attaboy, Angel.

52
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,810
Here, this trail - steady stream of drops.

53
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,310
He had a few seconds.
Tried to move away until...

54
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,820
Till he fell.

55
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,990
So much blood.

56
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,540
What's happening to me?

57
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,570
No way.

58
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,940
You're the one I'm supposed to meet.

59
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,360
In the flesh.

60
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,200
You know, I was just talking
to someone about you.

61
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,830
That tickles.

62
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,250
Don't stop.

63
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,380
I wouldn't dream of stopping.

64
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,930
You're so different this time.

65
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,640
Gentle.

66
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,470
I thought you were gonna try
and get all pervy with my stump again.

67
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,810
Actually, your... imperfection
is what saved you the first time.

68
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,900
Saved me from what?

69
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,570
True artistry.

70
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,450
The message of my work
is not in the product itself,

71
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,780
but rather the presentation.

72
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,950
That wrinkled flesh on your radial carpal
joint is far from perfect.

73
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,710
It's quite unsightly, actually.

74
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,130
Hey, you don't have
to be an asshole about it.

75
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,340
Hey, hey, no, no, no.

76
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,260
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend.

77
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,930
Truthfully...

78
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,180
I'm thankful for you.

79
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,850
You're my escape plan.

80
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,270
Escape from what?

81
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,480
The police.

82
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,360
Because of you,
I've had to speed up my project.

83
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,820
I need something to distract them by.

84
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,160
And I always found
a freshly chopped-up body

85
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,490
always does the trick.

86
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,700
Wait, wait! No!

87
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,160
Don't struggle. That never helps.

88
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,420
I'm compressing your carotid artery,

89
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,090
and that is cutting off oxygen to your brain.

90
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,130
In about ten seconds, you'll be unconscious.

91
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,910
Hey, it's Rudy. Leave a message.

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,540
OK, I guess you went to bed.

93
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,500
Or you fell asleep on the couch
watching Xena reruns,

94
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,000
which I still think makes you a dork.

95
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,170
Either way, call me when you get this, OK?

96
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Miss you.

97
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:39,010
He's still in surgery,
but I don't know when we'll hear anything.

98
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,520
So I guess you won't be coming over tonight.

99
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,230
No. I mean, I can't.

100
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,350
I understand.
You need to be there for your friend.

101
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,860
I haven't told the kids yet.

102
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,280
Told them about Angel?

103
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,110
No, about Paul... being back in prison?

104
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,490
I hate breaking their hearts.
They think so much of their dad now.

105
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,370
Right.

106
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,750
You know what?

107
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,330
Focus on Angel. We can talk about this later.

108
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,380
Thanks.

109
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,630
They're actually coming out
right now. I got to go.

110
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,270
Angel sustained severe internal injuries.

111
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,070
He lost a lot of blood.

112
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,730
But... the surgery was successful.

113
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,240
It looks like our boy's out of the woods.

114
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,620
I know I should stay,
be a part of the group hug.

115
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,290
But I can't focus.

116
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,750
I'm trapped in the clutches of a memory.

117
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,960
I need to know what it means.

118
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,600
What the fuck is wrong with you?

119
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,350
I have someplace I have to be.

120
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,440
We all got someplace to be.
But you just found out that somebody

121
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,490
who was supposed to be your friend is gonna
live. Does it make you feel anything?

122
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,910
Anything at all?

123
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,870
Take your fucking hand off me.

124
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,170
Just what I always thought.

125
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,130
Right.

126
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,240
Shit. Just what I need.

127
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,010
Hey.

128
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,930
I know it's late.

129
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,430
I guess you didn't get my message.

130
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,100
I drove by and saw your car.

131
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,520
I can go.

132
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,230
Get your ass in here.

133
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,070
It's about time you see where I live anyway.

134
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,860
Oh, you have no idea
how much I needed this.

135
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,200
You feel good.

136
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,330
And cold. You're freezing.

137
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,370
Well, then stay and keep me warm.

138
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,050
This Batista thing
has gotten to you, hasn't it?

139
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,890
Angel's daughter was there.

140
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,520
That's got to be rough.

141
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,230
Daughter of a cop, just like you.

142
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,200
I remember what that's like -

143
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,740
kissing your father goodbye,

144
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,080
always afraid it's for the last time.

145
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,330
Hey.

146
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,410
Let's get out of town for the weekend.

147
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,080
Just the two of us.

148
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,790
We need to talk.

149
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,470
I'm sitting right here.

150
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,590
Nope.

151
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,970
The time has got to be right.

152
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,430
OK.

153
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,980
It will have to wait...

154
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,480
At least till we catch the asshole
who did this to Batista.

155
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,610
Let me warn you - I can be very persistent.

156
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,320
I need to get out of town,

157
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,280
and I need you to come with me.

158
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,290
What I need is sleep,

159
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,830
which is not gonna be easy.
I'm totally wired from all this shit.

160
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,460
Well, lucky for you, I have the perfect cure.

161
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,420
My loving arms.

162
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,430
And... I got a little thing to help you sleep.

163
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,890
That ain't no little thing.

164
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,600
I meant Valium.

165
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,020
It's one of the perks working at the hospital.

166
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,560
Wine and Valium?

167
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,360
- I'll be totally helpless.
- You read my mind.

168
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,770
- Well, as I live and breathe!
- You miss me?

169
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,940
You and the bear claws
you're hiding behind your back.

170
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,320
This must be important.

171
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,190
Haven't seen much of you lately.

172
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,650
No rest for the wicked.

173
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,370
- How's Gene?
- Good days and bad.

174
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,290
He just finished his first round of radiation.

175
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,910
Well, he's a good guy.

176
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,580
Not much of a bridge player, though.

177
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,790
Harry and Gene used to get so mad

178
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,210
every time Doris and I'd take them
to the cleaners.

179
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,430
I was hoping you could dig up
an old case file for me.

180
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,050
Well, sure thing. Got a date?

181
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,930
Uh, not exactly.

182
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,600
It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

183
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,770
Uh... I wish I could help, but...

184
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,700
Everything from that long ago is boxed up
in the basement at City Hall.

185
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
And, as you can see,

186
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,580
I'm up to my you-know-what
in year-end reports, so...

187
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,000
It's my lieutenant.

188
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,800
Camilla, is there anything you remember?

189
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,180
What I remember, Dexter Morgan,
is your father caring enough

190
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,930
to bring you into his home
and give you a loving family.

191
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,060
I wouldn't keep your lieutenant waiting.

192
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,480
Who found the body parts?

193
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,110
I did. They were left under the tree.

194
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,150
I thought it was the crew from last night
messing around...

195
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,900
till I found the head.

196
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,280
I told him not to touch anything,
but he never listens.

197
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,950
God, Patty, you're such a bitch.

198
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,540
Did you guys see anything out of
the ordinary before you found the body?

199
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,330
There were some broken
ornaments by the tree.

200
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,340
Who'd do something like this
so close to Christmas?

201
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,210
The Grinch.

202
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,380
Oh, you're a fucking riot, Max!

203
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,220
Like anyone's gonna go shopping
down here after this.

204
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,140
- There go our jobs.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

205
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,890
Oh, sucks to be an elf.

206
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,690
- Sir, can you answer a question?
- ...any place with security cameras.

207
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,860
- Get some visual surveillance.
- I got here as fast as I could.

208
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,990
- What are we looking at?
- Female victim cut up into pieces.

209
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,280
The ice-truck killer? So soon?

210
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,620
Yep, and after the bloodbath at the hotel,

211
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,210
can't wait to see how the captain'll handle
the press on this one. James!

212
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,960
I need you to walk Dexter to the crime scene.

213
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,540
Will somebody turn off
this damn snow machine?

214
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,340
Your sister can help you out.

215
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,760
That a whole sexual-tension thing,
or am I missing something?

216
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,600
103.

217
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,600
It's the same numbers
he left at Marina View Hotel.

218
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,980
- Any leads as to what they mean?
- We've talked to numerologists,

219
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,690
code breakers - nothing.
They need more to go on.

220
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,030
First he turns my whole world inside out
with a carnival of blood.

221
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Now he leaves me this.

222
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,410
A calming oasis in the desert
of my confusion.

223
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,290
It doesn't make sense.

224
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,720
Crime scene's wiped clean.

225
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
Another hooker?

226
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Ho, ho, ho - another dead ho.

227
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,220
Somebody's been naughty.

228
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,850
Hey, Morgan, want to sit
on my lap when we're done

229
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,270
- and tell me what you want for Christmas?
- And he's back.

230
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,400
No, thanks. Last thing on my wish list
is a burning sensation when I pee.

231
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,230
This doesn't seem right.

232
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,110
Body parts scattered among the presents.

233
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,530
Broken ornaments.
It's not his usual meticulous style.

234
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,040
It seems rushed...

235
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,620
- haphazard.
- That would explain

236
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,420
why we can't find one of the hands.

237
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,050
What's wrong?

238
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,630
Something underneath the torso.

239
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,890
Merry Christmas, Miami.

240
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
After all this time,

241
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,650
why do you think the ice-truck killer
has struck again?

242
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,900
Any answer at this time would be
pure speculation on my part.

243
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,480
Do you think it has connection

244
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,320
with your department's handling
of the Neil Perry fiasco?

245
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,950
Sir?

246
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,750
You've arrested the wrong man.

247
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,750
Made the world think I'm a rank amateur,

248
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,090
and I'm very, very angry.

249
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,300
To answer for your mistakes...

250
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,180
- Stop the tape.
- What are you doing?

251
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,970
Look at her tears rolling up.

252
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,640
Oh, my God.

253
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,350
Bastard's got her upside down.

254
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,270
That's how he bleeds them out.
He strings them up like meat.

255
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,580
No, please, no!

256
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,420
- All right, turn it off.
- I'll have the tape sent to the station...

257
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,460
- ..for analysis.
- Sergeant Doakes, you're on point.

258
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,380
With all due respect,
Lieutenant LaGuerta's in charge...

259
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,630
- of this investigation.
- Not anymore.

260
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,090
We didn't catch this guy,
and now he's rubbing our noses in it.

261
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,680
We've got to come up
with some fresh ideas.

262
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,690
- This is some bullshit, I'll go talk to him.
- No, no, no. Do as he says.

263
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,520
The commissioner has his ass in a sling.

264
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,900
He's up for review.
Word is he's getting the boot.

265
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,990
You're just gonna sit back and take this?

266
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,580
If it means being seen as
his worthy successor... I'll be at the hospital.

267
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,450
All right, PB and J Inside,

268
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,790
cut diagonally, not straight across.

269
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,160
Tastes better that way.

270
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,830
Has Dad said if he's coming over
Christmas Eve

271
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,000
or Christmas morning?

272
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,630
I miss him.

273
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,380
I'm afraid your dad's not gonna
make it this year for the holidays.

274
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,760
Where is he?

275
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,680
Well, uh... He's...

276
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,390
He's back in jail, isn't he?

277
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,600
Look, I know he wanted to say goodbye,
but there wasn't any time.

278
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,020
He loves you guys so much.

279
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,570
I forgot my math book.

280
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm sure he'd love to hear from you.
We could write him a letter.

281
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,280
It's all your fault.

282
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,790
You could at least pretend
you want to be here.

283
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,380
- You had the urgent need for tacos.
- Yeah, so we could talk about Rudy.

284
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,800
He's been acting weird lately.

285
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,050
Last night he said we need to talk.

286
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,130
Well, that's never good.

287
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,350
Well, thanks. I feel a lot better.

288
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,100
I've only been obsessing about this all day.

289
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,600
Think you could talk to him for me?

290
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,270
- Oh, look, it's Rudy.
- I sort of called him.

291
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,900
Dex, Deb didn't tell me you'd be joining us.

292
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,030
Apparently she's had a lot on her mind.

293
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,070
Oh, shit.

294
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,820
That's work. I have to go.

295
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,450
Here, take mine. Sorry.

296
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What's with your lip?

297
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,340
Deb catch you with a right hook?

298
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,420
She can be protective with the remote.

299
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,180
I had a little workshop accident
this morning.

300
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,050
Doesn't look like it happened this morning.
The cut's already closing up.

301
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,010
Did I say... I meant yesterday morning.

302
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,980
I think I'm working too hard.

303
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,690
Anyway, I don't think my lip is
why Deb arranged this little chitchat.

304
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,320
My sister is afraid
there may be trouble in paradise.

305
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,700
Your sister's wrong.

306
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,700
So this whole "need to talk" thing?

307
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,030
I'm starting to look at the big picture.

308
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,710
She's someone I could see spending
the rest of my life with, you know?

309
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,960
No, I don't know.

310
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,550
But I do know that Deb's falling for you... hard.

311
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,880
- You hurt her...
- And you'll hurt me.

312
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,510
Something like that.

313
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,190
I'm tired of hearing you two gallinas cluck.

314
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,820
Hey, you.

315
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,740
You had us so worried.

316
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,740
If I'd have known

317
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,410
that this would get you back
in the same room with me,

318
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,370
I would have gotten stabbed sooner.

319
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,040
I'm gonna get the doctor.

320
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,630
No, no, no. What are you doing?

321
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,760
The doctor said you're lucky to be alive
and have a liver.

322
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,390
Well, that's why I got two, right?

323
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,060
It's a good thing
you decided to be a cop.

324
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,150
Tell me that you caught the cocksucker
that ruined one of my best shirts.

325
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,780
We don't have any leads.

326
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,610
Did you see anything?

327
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
No.

328
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,910
He was behind me.

329
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,750
I just felt the blade go in.

330
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,040
It happened so fast.

331
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,590
How long has Nina been here?

332
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,470
She was the first one at the hospital.

333
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,640
She's been with you the whole time.

334
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,160
My mother was murdered before my eyes.

335
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,540
Makes sense I'd choose a life
where I search for meaning in blood.

336
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,830
The sole memory I have of her
is being covered in it.

337
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,290
I need to know more details.

338
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,220
I hope that look means you found something
on Batista's shirt.

339
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,970
You should see this.

340
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,970
That's what I drove
all the way back from the hospital for?

341
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,350
This drop of blood doesn't match the wound
pattern or the spatter

342
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,690
from the rest of the shirt,

343
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,940
and it is on the inside of the back collar.

344
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,440
He was stabbed from behind.

345
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,400
- Could it be the attacker's blood?
- Batista fought back.

346
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,570
Well, run the DNA. If this guy's got priors,
we'll get a hit on the database.

347
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,950
I sent a sample to the lab.

348
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,370
Let's get this together. Come on. Let's go.

349
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,040
Bring the monitor over here.

350
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,000
Sorry to hear, you know,
about Matthews taking you off the case.

351
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,630
Last gasp of a desperate man.

352
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,800
Things are gonna change around here.

353
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,470
And I won't forget your help.

354
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,060
And I'm very, very angry.

355
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,400
Oh, God, no! No, please!

356
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,730
I can't watch this again.

357
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,360
I know it's tough,
but keep your eyes on the monitor.

358
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,950
Wait, what was that?

359
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:41,030
The camera tilts up
right before he hits the off switch. Watch.

360
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,290
That, my friends,
is a monster refrigeration unit.

361
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:49,250
- He needs it cold to preserve the bodies.
- But check this out.

362
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,170
Look at the space there is
between her feet and the ceiling.

363
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,260
This room is bigger than a commercial freezer.
Likely it was a custom build.

364
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,680
We should focus our search
on commercial districts.

365
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,760
No. Residential.

366
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,680
You think he built it in his own place?

367
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,970
He picks up hookers, right? I worked Vice.

368
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,560
Smart girls know not to go
near a factory or a warehouse

369
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,100
unless you never want to be seen again.

370
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,520
How do we know
he didn't knock out his victims

371
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,980
or drug them, then take them
to a warehouse?

372
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:17,110
No other victim showed
signs of head injury or narcotics.

373
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,120
Besides, what better way to trap a victim
than to get her into your own home?

374
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,660
The escort service said
she was meeting a client

375
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,910
between Brickell Avenue and Coral Way.

376
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,120
And her body was found
at Santa's Cottage, on Biscayne Mall.

377
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,290
We'll map out grids.

378
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,920
Focus on private residences

379
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,460
drawing large amounts of power
near those areas.

380
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,760
Catch a break...

381
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,800
we'll catch this son of a bitch.

382
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,010
- Where the hell are you going?
- To do some research on a case.

383
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,140
You had to call me after the lunch with Rudy.

384
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,350
I've been freaking out. He sent me this.

385
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,400
"Cum sail away with me?"

386
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,310
He misspelled "come."

387
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,320
Dexter, this is no time to joke.

388
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,900
This is good, right? A romantic weekend?

389
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,610
What did he say to you?

390
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,660
Oh, wait, no. Don't. Don't tell me.

391
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,700
Maybe he wants it to be a surprise.

392
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,660
Unless I should know. Should I know?

393
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,830
OK, tell me.

394
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,540
You know, no. Don't.

395
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,670
"We need to talk"? Who says it
unless you're getting dumped?

396
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,000
- I don't think it's about that.
- Maybe wants me on the water

397
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,300
in case I make a scene.

398
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,260
I always do this. I put myself out there.

399
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,180
- I set myself up to get hurt.
- He wants to be part of the family.

400
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,430
What?

401
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,390
Wait.

402
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,680
Like... propose?

403
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,520
I have to get to the library before it closes,
but we'll talk about this later, OK?

404
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,520
Oh, my God.

405
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,820
Oh, my God!

406
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,250
I was never one to dwell on my past,

407
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,620
always content to leave it a mystery.

408
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,710
No details.

409
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,750
Just a blur of images rushing by.

410
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,300
But my friend out there wants
to bring those memories into focus.

411
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,010
So do I.

412
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,350
This is it for the Metro News
for 1972 through 1973.

413
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,520
The Tribune's archives...

414
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,330
10/3?

415
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,130
1-0-3. Same as the hotel,
same as Santa's Cottage.

416
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,130
This is what he wanted me to find all along.

417
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,510
Close your eyes.

418
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,680
Don't look.

419
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,600
Laura Moser...

420
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,400
my mother.

421
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:02,400
No wonder I felt so
disconnected my entire life.

422
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,740
If I did have emotions, I'd have to feel...

423
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,070
...this.

424
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,250
October third, 1973.

425
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,550
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chainsaw.

426
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,380
A drug dealer didn't appreciate
Laura and her friends stealing his cocaine.

427
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,630
First officer on scene was Harry Morgan.

428
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,970
- You've been busy.
- A crime that big

429
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,140
and yet there's no record of the case file
at City Hall. That seems a bit odd.

430
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,480
It's a long time ago.

431
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,600
What is in that report
that Harry didn't want me to see?!

432
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,900
Why was there no mention in newspapers
about a three-year-old boy at the crime scene?

433
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,910
Damn it, I need to know. I need that file.

434
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,370
I can't give you the file
'cause it no longer exists.

435
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,830
I destroyed it the day your adoption
went through.

436
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,710
You did what?

437
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,290
Made a promise to your father.

438
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,630
Why, to protect him?

439
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,340
To protect you.

440
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,850
Harry had a code.
He'd never ask you to destroy evidence.

441
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,560
Your father was a decent man
and an honest cop,

442
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,770
but what he saw
in that cargo container changed him.

443
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,400
You were left there for days, starving,
in blood two inches thick.

444
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,420
- Dex, Cody's run away!
- Are you sure?

445
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,250
Yeah, I've looked everywhere.

446
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,510
- Call the police. I'll be right there.
- OK.

447
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,260
I need to know the truth.

448
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,760
Kid...

449
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,020
...leave this one alone.

450
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,310
I can't sit here,
I should be out there doing something.

451
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,570
Rita, the police said
you need to stay here

452
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,280
in case Cody comes home.
The neighbors are helping. We'll find him.

453
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,160
Yeah, but one squad car for all of Miami?

454
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,700
What if some crazy person
picked him up off the street?

455
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,750
It's all my fault.

456
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,550
- Honey, what are you talking about?
- I should have heard Cody get out of bed.

457
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,260
I'm his big sister.

458
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,220
Hey. Hey, look at me.

459
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,470
It's not your fault, OK?

460
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,230
Could you go get Dexter some water?

461
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,900
Oh, God.

462
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,490
I should have seen this coming.

463
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,700
Cody was so upset with me when I told him
that Paul was back in jail.

464
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,580
Paul.

465
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,540
- Today's Thursday, right?
- Yeah.

466
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,750
I think I know where Cody might be.

467
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,970
Hey.

468
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,760
Need a push?

469
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,480
Today's the day you meet Daddy
in the park, huh?

470
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,940
He'll be here.

471
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,440
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry,
but he's not coming back.

472
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,110
Not for a long time.

473
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,620
Look, we'll talk about this
when we get home, OK?

474
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,990
After all the lies
Harry left for me to uncover,

475
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,160
I'd love to run away, too.

476
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,670
He won't even look at me.

477
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm not the one in jail,
and yet I'm still the bad guy.

478
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,340
Well, you didn't tell them the truth...

479
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,470
about their father.

480
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,590
I told them Paul was back in jail.

481
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,560
Well, right, you told them where he is,
but not who he is.

482
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,390
He's still the same drug-using,
wife-beating redneck he always was.

483
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,270
They should hear that.

484
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,400
You're not a parent. You don't understand.
You do anything to protect your kids.

485
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,490
Rita, wake up. You're not protecting them,
you're protecting Paul.

486
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,490
Well, I... I got to get them home.

487
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,550
Somebody's in a good mood.

488
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,720
The commissioner and the review board
did not look happy this morning.

489
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,970
They've been in Matthews' office
for two hours.

490
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,270
You thinking his ass is
three shades of red now?

491
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,400
I don't care what color it is
as long as it's on its way out the door.

492
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,910
- Tell me that did not just happen.
- It's who you know and who you blow.

493
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,210
- Probably picking their fucking tee time.
- Maria, watch your back.

494
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,040
He's gonna be gunning for you
now more than ever.

495
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,800
Let him try.

496
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,470
My man Juan, hook it up.

497
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,720
They didn't have Road & Track so...

498
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,060
- That better be a bag of applesauce.
- OK, at this point,

499
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,020
you should go save yourself. Go.

500
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,690
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

501
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,860
Two double-meats?

502
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,570
A man's got to eat.

503
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,120
You're so cute when you're annoyed.

504
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,120
- Your mouth makes those little O's.
- God damn it, Angel,

505
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,120
do I look like I'm being cute with you?

506
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,790
- Well, not now you don't, no.
- Why do you always do this...

507
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,510
- make light of things that matter?
- OK, I'm sorry. OK?

508
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,130
When I come home,
I'll eat anything you want.

509
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,760
No jokes, no complaining. I promise.

510
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,600
When you come home?

511
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,980
I thought the way things are going with us...

512
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,100
I thought you'd forgiven me.

513
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,240
Well, of course I forgive you.

514
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,780
- I forgave you a long time ago.
- OK, so let's fix this.

515
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,700
This could be a second chance for us.

516
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,790
What?

517
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,630
Look, you did what you did.

518
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,630
It was hard.

519
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,970
But it got us to face the truth.

520
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,930
We were miserable...

521
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,180
for years.

522
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,850
Do you really want to survive this
and go right back to being unhappy?

523
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
Maybe.

524
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,940
What if I do?

525
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,240
Look, you will always be Auri's father.

526
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,870
I will always care about you.

527
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,960
I'll always be here for you.

528
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,170
But our marriage is over.

529
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,890
Why, yes, by all means, Tom, please, come in.

530
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,610
Maria... let's you and me have a talk.

531
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:41,030
Congratulations on the review.
I hear it went well. You must be thrilled.

532
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,860
- But, if you don't mind...
- Let me get to the point.

533
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,490
All our mishaps these last few months -

534
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,120
failure to bring in the ice-truck killer,

535
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,330
mishandling of Tony Tucci...

536
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,370
- even Neil Perry.
- That was your fuck-up...

537
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,330
not mine.

538
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,130
They're all the result of
a bad command structure,

539
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,460
and that's my failure.

540
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,050
Well...

541
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,850
I'm glad to hear you say that.

542
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,850
Takes a big man to admit his own mistakes.

543
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,400
So this morning,
the commissioner gave me the go-ahead

544
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,860
to restructure the division.

545
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:23,240
Effective immediately,
you'll no longer serve as my lieutenant.

546
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,870
I'm sorry. I know this must be difficult for you.

547
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,330
Please, it's ridiculous.

548
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,460
- You really don't want to do this.
- Because of your status...

549
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,960
- in the Cuban community.
- I'm a fucking hero to this community.

550
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,300
- You think they'll accept it?
- Your replacement's been selected.

551
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,930
Her name is EsmÃ© Pascal,

552
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,890
a transfer from Fort Lauderdale.
A real up-and-comer.

553
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,430
Pascal, the Haitian-American?

554
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,690
- Who got shot last year in the line of duty.
- Turns out she's an actual hero.

555
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,650
If you think I'm gonna stay quiet,
you're out of mind.

556
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,440
I did warn you, Maria.

557
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,780
I need you to clear out this office tonight.

558
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,990
- Expect a call from my union rep.
- You'll always have a place in the bullpen...

559
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,370
And my fucking lawyer, too!

560
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,710
- ...with the other detectives.
- This isn't fucking over, Tom!

561
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:22,630
You goddamn son of a bitch!

562
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,390
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

563
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,640
How are you?

564
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,980
How the hell do I look?

565
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,850
I can barely remember how I got here.

566
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,980
There's something we need to discuss.

567
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,860
If you came for an apology,
you wasted a tank of gas.

568
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,230
Sit. I'm not finished.

569
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,570
Fuck you.

570
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,490
Astor and Cody are in the other room.

571
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,700
Jesus, you brought them here?

572
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,200
I know this'll be difficult,

573
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,870
but I need you to explain
to them why you're here.

574
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,040
I have no fucking idea why I'm in this place.

575
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,050
Fine. Fine.
You want to be in denial? Go ahead.

576
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,180
You will never see your kids again.

577
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,260
Wait, wait, wait.

578
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,390
Rita, wait, wait.

579
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,890
I fought so hard to win those kids back,

580
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,730
especially Astor.

581
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,770
If they see me here like this,
I'm gonna lose them forever.

582
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,320
Paul, the one good thing that
came out of our marriage are those kids.

583
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,110
And I know you love them.

584
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,700
But if you want to have
any kind of real relationship with them,

585
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,870
it has to be with the father they have,

586
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,080
not the father they wish they had.

587
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,290
Now, you cheated on me.

588
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,750
You broke my heart, you broke my bones,

589
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,500
and I took it so those kids wouldn't have to.

590
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,510
But I am giving you the chance
to make it all right.

591
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,600
Not for me, but for them.

592
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,520
I wouldn't know what to say.

593
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,400
Tell them you're paying for your mistakes.

594
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,770
It's a valuable lesson.

595
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,400
It's one you never got.

596
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,410
So what's it gonna be?

597
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,460
OK.

598
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,460
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

599
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,790
Hey!

600
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,270
All right. This won't take long.

601
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,980
There was a drop of blood
on the back of your shirt that wasn't yours,

602
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,520
so I need to check the back of your head.

603
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,110
As long as it's only my head
you're checking back there.

604
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,570
How're things with Rita?

605
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,370
Not so good, actually.
We kind of... had words.

606
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,250
- I think I really upset her.
- Oh, that's rough, man.

607
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,540
Maybe I'm not the person for her.
Some people are meant to be alone.

608
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,210
- Right?
- Dex, socio, alone sucks.

609
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,470
Sorry.

610
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,560
These are teeth marks.
You definitely wounded this guy.

611
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,020
Good. I hope I broke his fucking nose...

612
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,600
At least I gave him a fat lip.

613
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,610
Angel, have you ever met
Deb's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper?

614
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,700
Yeah. I went by his office
a couple of days ago.

615
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,160
Nice guy. Why?

616
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,830
At lunch, Rudy said he'd hurt
his lip that morning.

617
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,040
He was lying,
and I was too distracted to care.

618
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,210
But he's got my full attention now.

619
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,010
- You here tonight?
- Yeah,

620
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,680
we're tits-deep in the ice-truck killer.
Might be onto something.

621
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,770
- It will be an all-nighter.
- So that text you got from Rudy

622
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,810
about going away with him,
you're not gonna do that?

623
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,480
Tragically, no.

624
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,230
I was psyched to meet him
at the Miami Beach Marina,

625
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,610
but this bullpen's my home till we finish this.

626
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,820
- Good.
- Good? I'm working on a theory that

627
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,410
Rudy was gonna propose,
now he can't. Is it good?

628
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,580
No, good you're making progress here.

629
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,250
Yeah. We're getting closer.

630
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,330
Fingers crossed.

631
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,750
At least I know my sister
is safe tonight,

632
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,050
which gives me time to check
out my own theory on Rudy.

633
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,920
We defined the area
for the residential search.

634
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,430
Good. So we'll start canvassing tonight.
You take the...

635
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,890
That him?

636
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,640
Yeah, how'd you know?

637
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,650
'Cause you got that stupid-ass grin
on your face again.

638
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,860
Go ahead. Answer it.

639
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,660
- Hey.
- Hey, supercop, what's the word?

640
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,120
- I'm kind of in a thing right now.
- Got it. I'll be quick.

641
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,620
You never answered my text.

642
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,620
Do I have the pleasure of your company...

643
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,120
- this weekend?
- Uh, yeah, about that...

644
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,130
Come on, Deb, it's only two days.

645
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,710
It's just we've had a major break
in the ice-truck-killer case.

646
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,930
I promise, as soon as we catch
this douchebag,

647
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:22,220
you and I are gonna spend
a whole week in bed.

648
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,060
You are not gonna be able to get rid of me.

649
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,850
OK, but how about dinner?

650
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,980
Oh, my God, you are persistent.

651
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,650
Well, you got to eat, right?
So why not eat dinner with me...

652
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,820
on this yacht I'm on?

653
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:39,320
- Where the hell did you get a yacht?
- I rented it.

654
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:45,160
I thought we'd have a nice couple days
together, but we could still have a nice night.

655
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,620
And there is that thing
we need to talk about.

656
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,000
OK, well, maybe I can take
an hour for dinner.

657
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,590
- I can work with an hour.
- I mean, a real hour, not one of your

658
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,130
"Let's stretch this out till two a.m.,
you might as well stay and have sex" hours.

659
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,010
Right.

660
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,430
Real hour. No fakey hour. Got it.

661
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,390
All right, I'll get out of here as fast as I can.
I'll see you soon.

662
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,860
Thinking Rudy attacked Batista
doesn't make sense.

663
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,190
He's a loving boyfriend.

664
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,200
He spends his life helping people in need.

665
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,910
He brought me steaks.

666
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,490
Well, that's just rude.

667
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:31,370
Why would loving and helpful Rudy

668
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,540
need an industrial-grade lock...

669
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,000
and a security camera?

670
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,670
How do I get his DNA now?

671
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,910
At times like this, I wish the truth was
more easily accessible, and less...

672
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:06,780
ripe.

673
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:10,870
But Harry taught me to trust my gut.

674
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,790
"People lie all the time," he said.

675
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,170
"But your instinct will never fail you."

676
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,050
Some blood from a cut lip, perhaps?

677
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,720
Fuck me!

678
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,560
I believe your rule specifically prohibits
such action.

679
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,490
- Did you do all this?
- In fact, I did.

680
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,490
- You like?
- I like.

681
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,500
I like so much that it makes
what I have to tell you harder.

682
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,960
- Oh, please tell me you're not leaving.
- I'm sorry. I hit traffic.

683
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,040
It took me 30 minutes to get here.
I have to turn around and go right back.

684
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:03,000
Oh, my God.

685
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:07,180
- Hold on. Hold on! Wait.
- Well, you're sort of forcing my hand here.

686
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,810
I wanted to wait until we were
out in the water, but... here goes.

687
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,020
I know this seems fast...

688
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,600
but I feel...

689
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:24,030
I feel that I waited my whole entire life
for you. And now that you're here,

690
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,530
I don't want you to leave.

691
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,610
Debra Morgan...

692
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,530
will you marry me?

693
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,490
I knew it! I fucking knew it!

694
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,500
Is that your version of a "yes"?

695
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,170
Yes, yes, yes, yes, but...

696
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,040
No, no, no! Stop at "yes."

697
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,710
- I like that part.
- Yes, but let's slow it down, you know?

698
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,340
Let me savor this.
I want to be with you.

699
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,840
I want to enjoy it, you know?

700
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:53,430
- So it's a "yes," but...
- OK, I get it.

701
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,680
- You do?
- Not really, but I can work with it.

702
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,890
Good, good.

703
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:03,690
- Oh, God, I can still wear the ring, right?
- Yes, but... there's a condition.

704
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,030
I know you have to go to work, but...

705
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,950
if you're gonna wear the ring,
we need to celebrate.

706
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:12,530
One glass of champagne, that's all I ask.

707
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,200
- Rudy, I...
- I mean it.

708
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:17,410
You can't leave your sort-of fiancÃ©
on a yacht with a cold meal

709
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,040
and an unopened bottle of champagne,
it's cruel.

710
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,630
Just one glass of champagne...
to celebrate.

711
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,720
And then you can go back,
save Miami from the ice-truck killer.

712
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,340
I can live with that.

713
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,520
I need these two tested against
each other. It's kind of a rush.

714
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,400
Excuse me, hi.

715
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,940
Hey, these two - tested against
each other right now.

716
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,360
OK.

717
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,750
- It's Deb. Do it.
- Hey, I know you're working,

718
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,750
but let me know when you come up for air.

719
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,920
I need to talk to you. I'm in the building.

720
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,510
This yacht's amazing.

721
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,800
I didn't know you went for stuff like this.

722
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,470
Oh, you have a lot to learn about me.

723
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,600
- Was that the phone ringing?
- Yeah.

724
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,310
Big brother. I let it go to voice mail.
He can wait till we're done here.

725
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,230
Good. I want you all to myself.

726
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,610
So...

727
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,570
let the toasting begin.

728
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,280
To...

729
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,660
what comes next.

730
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,750
You're not drinking.

731
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,960
Tastes like menthol,

732
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,800
which, it turns out, is not that sexy.

733
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,270
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

734
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,360
Just bad memories.

735
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,860
Oh. That's right.

736
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,150
That was the...

737
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,110
the one clue
the ice-truck killer left behind, right?

738
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:16,740
Right.

739
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,370
Wait. How did you know that?

740
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,000
I don't often make mistakes,

741
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,120
but when I do, they haunt me.

742
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,460
Hilarious.

743
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,340
Your champagne's gonna get warm.

744
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,010
You know the one thing
I've been dying to ask you?

745
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,970
How did you not know who I was?

746
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,310
You're a cop.

747
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,650
This isn't funny.

748
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:52,150
I think a real cop would at least have
a sense that she was in the presence

749
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,490
of the person she was hunting, right?

750
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:57,320
You're hurting me!

751
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,830
I didn't show you the best part of my loft.
Built it myself.

752
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,620
Stop it!

753
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,870
My refrigerated room.

754
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,540
Oh, God, why are you doing this?

755
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,300
The tricky part was getting you on the boat.

756
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,720
The other women I could just pay.

757
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,180
But at the end...

758
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,100
you made it easy.

759
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,350
So desperate to fall in love.

760
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,690
Stop.

761
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,200
Dude, you got to see this.

762
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,420
The autopsy on our Santa's Cottage victim?

763
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,130
Check it out.

764
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,130
One arm was shorter than the other.

765
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,500
So that got me thinking.

766
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,880
I mean, our guy isn't sloppy. He's precise.

767
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,300
Not now, Vince.

768
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,760
Her left wrist was
two inches shorter than her right.

769
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,890
I mean, why cut off more
on the left side than the right?

770
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,940
Because our girl...

771
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,900
our girl was a fucking amputee.

772
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,280
I looked up her medical records.

773
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,610
She had a fake left hand.

774
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,320
That's why we couldn't find it.

775
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,570
The killer cut off that extra piece of wrist

776
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,330
- ..so that we wouldn't see the stump.
- Let me see that.

777
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:27,660
That night Batista was stabbed,
he was following up on a lead

778
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:31,120
he got from a one-handed call girl.
Guess what the lead was about.

779
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,130
The ice-truck killer.

780
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,340
You sure?

781
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,010
Positive. The samples
you gave me were a match.

782
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,770
They were from the same person.

783
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,190
Hey, you all right?

784
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,990
Where's my sister?

785
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,200
Took her Code 12. Left about an hour ago.

786
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,450
She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

787
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,200
Dispatch, this is Dexter Morgan.

788
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:12,250
I need you to raise Officer
Debra Morgan on her radio.

789
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,340
Sorry, sir. She's been out of range
for the last half-hour.

790
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,090
It's Deb. Do it.

791
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,470
Where the fuck are you?
I'm here at work, you're not.

792
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,600
I need to talk to you.

793
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,850
Do not see Rudy until you find me.

794
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,980
Call me when you get this.
