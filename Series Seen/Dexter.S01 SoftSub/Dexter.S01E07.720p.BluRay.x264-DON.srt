1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,350
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,980
It is my new friend.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,730
When he broke into my apartment,

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,810
he took some time
to get to know me - my life,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,110
my secrets.

6
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,530
Same as the others - no blood.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,950
Somebody who was here
last night saw something.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,160
They got a night watchman,
but we can't find him.

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,080
It's the guard - Tucci.

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,080
I think he's alive.

11
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,500
They're taking Tucci over to County.

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,999
Rudy here is gonna put me
back together again.

13
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:35,509
Yo, pretty boy,
you're stealing my thunder.

14
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:38,418
I don't know, I just might
have to fight you for this one.

15
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:43,508
Was he the man you saw
at the old hospital that night, Mr. Perry?

16
00:00:43,638 --> 00:00:46,178
It was difficult to tell.
It was dark.

17
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:49,848
Florida prisons kick free
25,000 inmates a year.

18
00:00:49,978 --> 00:00:52,728
I search for the ones who think
they beat the system,

19
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:54,018
like Jeremy Downs.

20
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:55,608
Jeremy got off easy.

21
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,688
To the coroner, the knife
strokes looked random,

22
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:00,738
but I saw the work
of a young virtuoso.

23
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:03,568
Are you gonna fuck me?

24
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,828
'Cause I killed
the last guy who raped me.

25
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:08,908
I understand now.

26
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:11,458
Jeremy didn't murder that boy
four years ago.

27
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:13,748
He was taking out the garbage.

28
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:15,038
Wait, is that all?

29
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:20,414
The FBI estimates that there are
less than 50 serial killers

30
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:22,244
active in the United States today.

31
00:03:27,794 --> 00:03:29,714
We don't get together at conventions,

32
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:34,174
share trade secrets,
or exchange Christmas cards...

33
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:37,304
but sometimes I wonder
what it's like for the others.

34
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,813
The only sound I hear,

35
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:46,143
the only sound in the entire world...

36
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,153
is my heart beating.

37
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,622
I swear, after this case,

38
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:09,792
I'm submitting your ass
for psychiatric evaluation.

39
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:13,962
I'm just retracing castoff patterns,
directionality angles.

40
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:17,552
- Can you tell us what happened here?
- It's an execution.

41
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,802
The kid's an honor student,
editor of his yearbook.

42
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,392
It's all in the knife work.

43
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:25,022
Skillful, no wasted motion.
The killer had experience.

44
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:27,852
Every stroke hit a major artery...

45
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,362
or at least came close.

46
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:42,491
Are you getting a goddamn
hard-on there, Morgan?

47
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,201
No, it's truly horrific.
He was yearbook committee, you said?

48
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,371
I want your report on this tomorrow.

49
00:04:56,211 --> 00:05:00,931
I wish I could say Doakes is
my biggest problem, but he's not.

50
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:05,721
I've seen these wounds before.

51
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:11,020
You're drooling on LaGuerta's couch.

52
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,610
Pulling a midnight shift?

53
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,110
Lopez has the trots.

54
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
- Why are you still here?
- Why not?

55
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,110
Nothing at home except an empty fridge
and an empty bed.

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,200
If I wasn't married
and ten years younger...

57
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,330
I'd still be in high school. Keep dreaming.

58
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,080
Wiseass.

59
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,620
I've been chasing leads
on the ice-truck killer.

60
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,370
Pathetic long shots, mostly.

61
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,420
Yeah? What kind of leads?

62
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,670
I looked at the research,
with mass murderers,

63
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,460
it's dumb shit that trips them up.

64
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,799
Son of Sam got a parking ticket
outside his own crime scene.

65
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:45,139
So you ran parking violations
at the crime scenes of our guy?

66
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:46,469
Smart.

67
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,849
Yeah, but none of the registered
owners had criminal records.

68
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,439
Try "moving violations."

69
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:57,069
Timothy McVeigh drove
way too fast on the way out of town.

70
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,739
Neil Perry, I know that name.

71
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,169
He came as a witness two weeks ago when
pieces of Tony Tucci were showing up.

72
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,499
He rode through a stop sign
two blocks from the third crime scene

73
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,128
at the Seven Seas motel.

74
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:24,678
Why would a voluntary witness
be at two separate crime scenes?

75
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:27,348
I don't know, maybe he was
chopping up hookers.

76
00:06:27,468 --> 00:06:30,018
Holy mother of fuck, is this him?

77
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:31,978
Let's find out.

78
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,228
Is this the right address?

79
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:39,358
According to DMV,
this is where Perry lives.

80
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,028
With his seven inbred cousins,
by the look of it.

81
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:45,447
Something must be wrong with
somebody that can live in a steel box.

82
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,407
Aluminum, actually.

83
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,827
Nina and I had a deluxe multisectional.

84
00:06:49,947 --> 00:06:52,327
- For real?
- It was our starter home.

85
00:06:54,617 --> 00:06:56,327
This is our car.

86
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,747
One victim was seen getting in
a wood-paneled station wagon.

87
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,507
All right, one step at a time.
Let's find our guy.

88
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:06,887
According to his files, he works
as a computer analyst for Miami Lake.

89
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,847
Look up... slowly.

90
00:07:12,227 --> 00:07:13,887
Take the front door, cover the exits.

91
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,767
- I'm going to the back.
- OK.

92
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,777
Open up, Perry! It's the police!

93
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:29,196
Open up, Perry! Police!

94
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,366
Open up, Perry!

95
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,166
Open the door!

96
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:41,876
Hey, Angel, I got him!

97
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:44,585
Police! Stop running, Perry!

98
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,965
Get the fuck down!

99
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,015
Fuck!

100
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:15,035
I knew I recognized
the knife work of the killer.

101
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,785
Jeremy Downs.

102
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,785
I had him.

103
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,795
He was mine... until I found out
the boy Jeremy killed raped him.

104
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:24,955
He fucked me and I killed him.

105
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:26,875
So I let Jeremy go.

106
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,925
It seemed fair.

107
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,635
But my random act of kindness
was misguided.

108
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:34,215
If I'd followed my instincts,

109
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,934
this boy's high school yearbook
would still have an editor.

110
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,394
Captain Matthews
is coordinating the FDLE...

111
00:08:40,514 --> 00:08:42,934
to launch a statewide manhunt...

112
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:47,563
The task force will tear apart
the house for evidence

113
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,693
that links Neil Perry
to the ice-truck murders.

114
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:53,823
We'll need proof this time, people,
tangible proof.

115
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,443
What is it?

116
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:58,823
They really found the ice-truck killer?

117
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:00,453
I did.

118
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:02,413
Yes, yes.

119
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,913
We will financially guarantee
extradition from anywhere.

120
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:07,253
- James?
- I'm on it. I'll run the task force.

121
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:10,423
I need you and Pullman
to stay with the knife victim.

122
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:12,843
His parents are high-profile.

123
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,383
Whatever you need.

124
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:19,473
Angel, you found Perry.
You run the task force.

125
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:21,843
Contact the fugitive's friends, family,

126
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:24,513
coworkers, coke dealer,
anybody who might hide him.

127
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:27,183
- You want us to circulate his photo?
- In neighborhoods only.

128
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:30,523
Keep it away from the media.
This case stays low-profile.

129
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,733
The last thing I need is another Tony Tucci.

130
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,823
- Anything else, Lieutenant?
- Yes...

131
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:37,653
choose members who can put
their regular duties aside

132
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:40,363
and bust ass until
Neil Perry's apprehended.

133
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:42,113
OK. Dominic.

134
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:43,493
That's all. Thank you.

135
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,701
- You really think this is the guy?
- It's all lining up.

136
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:50,661
I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

137
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,671
Debra Morgan.

138
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:55,711
Get over here. You're on the team.

139
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:58,711
Do you hear that? I'm on the team.

140
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,631
You think we get hats?

141
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:03,261
Hardly looks a guy
capable of terrorizing Miami.

142
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,971
A science camp, maybe.

143
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:10,521
I'm off. I'll keep you in the loop.

144
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,521
- Where's my blood report, Sparky?
- I'm on it, Sergeant.

145
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:30,121
- How you doing, Mrs. Bennett?
- Hey, Charlie.

146
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:31,291
Where are the kids?

147
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,791
Your husband swung by. He didn't tell you?

148
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:35,961
I've never seen Cody light up like that.

149
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,631
- Big treat, the old man coming down.
- Wait, wait.

150
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:41,881
- Paul?
- He just picked up the kids.

151
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:45,341
You gave my children to Paul?
Are you stupid?

152
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:49,010
I told the administrative office
that Cody and Astor

153
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,890
are not to be released into his custody!

154
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,899
- Well, nobody told me.
- He just got out of fucking jail!

155
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:01,819
Everyone, follow strict, sterile protocol.

156
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:06,239
There will be no contamination
of my crime scene.

157
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:10,289
Bag anything that could be used to murder
or dispose of a human body.

158
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,369
That's pretty much everything in here, boss.

159
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:14,869
Except this.

160
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:18,459
- He's a sick fuck.
- Some might say that.

161
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:22,209
To others,
crypto-taxidermy is a fine art.

162
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,719
I got a mummified chupacabra at home.

163
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,339
Can I run Masuka's prints
as the ice-truck killer?

164
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:31,309
No need for that. I'll give you
some warm DNA right now.

165
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,559
God, you're gross. I didn't hear that.

166
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,979
Detective, I found something.

167
00:11:37,109 --> 00:11:39,399
An archive of hidden files.

168
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,149
A lot of how-to documents,
draining blood from cattle,

169
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,529
- wartime amputation techniques.
- "Butchering the human carcass"?

170
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,569
Even an article about countries
that don't extradite to the US.

171
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,868
- We've got this fucker.
- We got jack shit, Morgan.

172
00:11:51,998 --> 00:11:55,498
Everything in here is circumstantial.
We need hard evidence.

173
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:59,748
Hey, I'm not done looking yet. Are you?

174
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:04,667
The school had no right
to give my children to Paul.

175
00:12:04,797 --> 00:12:07,047
- No, they didn't.
- He lost his custody rights

176
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,847
right around the time
my head hit the living-room wall.

177
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:13,387
- I would think so.
- I should be out looking for my kids.

178
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:17,017
The best thing to do for them
is stay here in case he tries to call.

179
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,847
What if he doesn't?

180
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:23,687
What if he kidnapped them
to get back at me for putting him in jail?

181
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:24,987
Dexter, I...

182
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:31,867
- Hi!
- I got ya.

183
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:37,577
Mom, look, it's Dad. He came home.

184
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:41,037
What, you think I was
gonna move to the moon?

185
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,667
Stop it. Just stop.

186
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,257
You know I called the police?

187
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:49,087
- I told you I took them to the carnival.
- No, you didn't.

188
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:52,216
I called you at the hotel.
They said you were on a break,

189
00:12:52,346 --> 00:12:57,306
so I left a message
with the info and my cell number.

190
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:03,766
Hi. How are you?

191
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:07,316
I'm Paul Bennett, father on parole.

192
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:11,235
Dexter Morgan.

193
00:13:11,365 --> 00:13:14,655
I can't think of anything clever to say.

194
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:18,865
Paul, this is unacceptable.

195
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:22,915
I have custody. You can't just take them
without my permission.

196
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,875
I came to see my babies.

197
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:28,375
I missed them, Rita.

198
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:29,965
I missed a lot of things.

199
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:40,975
I should phone the station,
call off the dogs.

200
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:43,855
Dexter, look, my dad's home.

201
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:46,525
I see that, buddy.

202
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,284
Hey, Angel.

203
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:06,954
You're the expert on manufactured living.
This closet look a little small?

204
00:14:11,044 --> 00:14:12,714
A little.

205
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:28,473
Sweet.

206
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:41,153
I've got newspaper articles.

207
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:44,873
"Dismembered body found in a pool."
"Ice-truck killer appalls Miami."

208
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:47,663
- It's a record of everything he's done.
- I got photos.

209
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:51,003
- We gave the press crime scene photos?
- No.

210
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,503
- Did he take them himself?
- He had to.

211
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:56,672
- Did we just hit the mother lode?
- No.

212
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,712
We hit the motherfucking mother lode.

213
00:15:01,052 --> 00:15:03,432
The evidence just keeps piling up
at the mobile home.

214
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:06,802
I just authorized an excavation
of the back patio.

215
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:10,682
- I think there's something buried there.
- What are we doing to find Neil Perry?

216
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:13,482
I put his name in the system
and notified the FBI.

217
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:17,022
- Airports on alert?
- Airports, train stations, bus lines.

218
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:19,192
- Track his credit cards.
- Already done,

219
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:21,152
along with the ATMs and bank accounts.

220
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:23,822
I also put a tap on his home phone.

221
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:30,491
- Seems you thought of everything.
- Seems that way.

222
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,961
- Look, Maria...
- No need to apologize.

223
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:41,171
I don't require your approval to do my job.

224
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:44,881
I know that. I've been kicking your ass
'cause I knew you had this in you.

225
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,681
Well, thank you for making me
the woman I am today.

226
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,681
I love you to everything.

227
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,520
I love you to everything too.

228
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,990
He's not gonna hit you anymore.

229
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,450
He told me at the carnival.

230
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,570
I made him promise.

231
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,870
Thank you, baby.

232
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,920
I haven't had time to process
as much as the kids.

233
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,590
Paul was supposed to be
locked up for another year.

234
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,930
Cody seems to be processing OK.

235
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,600
Cody's too young.

236
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,059
A dad's just a concept to him, not a person.

237
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:39,269
But Astor...

238
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,399
she remembers
what he put us through.

239
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:47,199
At least you're not married anymore.

240
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,619
That's just it.

241
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:53,619
Technically, we are.

242
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:56,199
When Paul went to prison,
I started divorce proceedings,

243
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,998
but he refused to sign the paperwork.

244
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:01,668
As a power play?

245
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:02,788
I don't think so.

246
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:05,708
I think for all the darkness that haunts him,

247
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,628
Paul loves having a family.

248
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:10,588
I think he's just afraid to let go.

249
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:14,968
When did you first notice it?

250
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:20,148
This darkness inside the guy you fell for.

251
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:23,398
I always knew it was there.

252
00:17:23,518 --> 00:17:26,528
I guess I just didn't think I deserved better...

253
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,108
until I met you.

254
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:40,788
I have a dark side too.

255
00:17:43,457 --> 00:17:45,337
What? I do.

256
00:17:45,457 --> 00:17:48,167
Somehow I doubt that.

257
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:50,337
You have a good heart, Dexter.

258
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:54,177
You're not like Paul.
You don't hurt people.

259
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:00,886
Innocent people.

260
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:09,066
I don't hurt innocent people.

261
00:18:32,176 --> 00:18:34,886
Hey, dude, the bowling alley's
around the corner.

262
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:41,056
Hey, I'm looking for Jeremy Downs.

263
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,226
Jeremy?

264
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:45,146
He vacated the premises!

265
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,436
Focus.

266
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,186
I'm trying to find Jeremy.

267
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,895
Oh, I get it.

268
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:59,235
Look, man, I'm not really
into that homo shit,

269
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:02,454
but I'm kind of short on money for weed,

270
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,874
so I guess I'll do it for less
than Jeremy's charging.

271
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,914
Wait. What does Jeremy charge?

272
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:09,914
Jeremy's selling himself?

273
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:13,924
He's always hanging out with the
Brokeback boys down at Flamingo Park.

274
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:16,384
Comes back with fistfuls of cash.

275
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:27,434
It's me. Get your ass over
to Neil Perry's place.

276
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:28,764
You'll want to see this.

277
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:31,274
- Deb, it's my day off.
- Just get over here.

278
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:33,734
We're about to bust the ice-truck killer.

279
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,084
Not what I expected.

280
00:20:25,662 --> 00:20:27,662
So lifelike.

281
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:42,002
Hey, Dex. Thought you'd want to be here.

282
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:44,672
Something is buried down there.

283
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:46,092
I hate to break this to you,

284
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:48,892
but you know you've got
the wrong guy here, right?

285
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:51,512
The ice-truck killer drains
the blood from his victims,

286
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:54,182
freezes their bodies,
and then severs their limbs.

287
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:57,062
It's clean and efficient,
his psychological signature.

288
00:20:57,192 --> 00:21:01,442
- Neil Perry stuffs roadkill.
- And turns it into fucked-up fantasy shit.

289
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:02,942
But the fantasies are wrong.

290
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:06,611
The guy we're looking for wouldn't turn
dead things into living cartoons.

291
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:09,780
- He'd find that pathetic.
- How do you know?

292
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,320
Because it is pathetic.

293
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,740
Deb, trust me. Neil Perry is not a killer.

294
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,710
He's a dabbler. He's a waste of time.

295
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,670
If our guy took his early fantasies
out on animals,

296
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,250
he'd bury them, not display them.

297
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,050
And want about an early human kill?
Would he bury that too?

298
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,970
- Sure. Probably.
- Then turn around.

299
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,720
You were saying?

300
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,720
It looks like an adult female.

301
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,060
Any idea how long
the body's been down there?

302
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,730
Based on decomposition,

303
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,150
she's been tits up
for two, maybe three years.

304
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,110
We'll know more after the autopsy.

305
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,070
What happened to the limbs?
Did they rot off?

306
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,780
Nope.

307
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,240
They're clean cuts.

308
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,860
But he didn't chop up the whole body.

309
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,870
This could be Perry's first kill,
like he was experimenting.

310
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,660
You're the expert, Dex. What do you think?

311
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,960
Sure. Sounds good.

312
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,500
Actually, it sounds perfectly awful.

313
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:09,169
For weeks, I've felt like
a student in a master class.

314
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,389
Is it really possible
that the master's on the run?

315
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:18,058
And even more tragic,
does he live in a double-wide?

316
00:22:18,928 --> 00:22:23,938
The Gravitron goes so fast, Mom.
My dad took me on it three times.

317
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:26,068
Is that so?

318
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:29,938
All right, let me cut you up some fruit.

319
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:33,108
Astor wouldn't go. She was afraid.

320
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:36,238
So what? I don't like fast rides.

321
00:22:41,248 --> 00:22:42,578
Hello?

322
00:22:45,128 --> 00:22:47,458
- Who wants doughnuts?
- I do.

323
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:51,418
You can't walk in in whenever you want.
You don't live here anymore.

324
00:22:52,218 --> 00:22:54,888
Sorry about that. Old habits.

325
00:22:55,008 --> 00:22:58,098
I'll ring the doorbell next time.

326
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:03,388
I got these for you.

327
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:11,027
All right. I'll just put them in... something.

328
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:12,607
Dad, can I have a doughnut?

329
00:23:12,737 --> 00:23:14,487
You got it, buddy. Coming up.

330
00:23:14,617 --> 00:23:16,657
Now you're making me out
to be the bad guy?

331
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,787
They haven't had breakfast yet.

332
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:23,077
You know what? Kidlet, my bad.
Sorry about that.

333
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:25,496
These doughnuts are for after school.

334
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,956
But I could whip up
some eggs and pancakes.

335
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:30,836
- Paul!
- Very little syrup, I promise.

336
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,256
And meat. You into meat?

337
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:38,926
I like meat on my feet. It's real squishy.

338
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:40,716
Paul...

339
00:23:40,846 --> 00:23:44,766
- You can't do this anymore.
- What? What?

340
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:47,556
Help raise my kids?

341
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:51,026
Yes, I can. That's my job.

342
00:23:53,146 --> 00:23:54,776
All right, look.

343
00:23:56,446 --> 00:23:58,446
I can't even begin to understand

344
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:02,366
how difficult this has been for you,
being a single mom, OK?

345
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:08,326
And for that, I'm eternally sorry.

346
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:11,125
I let you down.

347
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:14,375
I let everybody down.

348
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:21,965
But if I could just find that frying pan.

349
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:26,185
Astor, want to help me
find the frying pan?

350
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:36,104
We got a profile of Neil Perry.

351
00:24:36,234 --> 00:24:37,774
He's a computer expert.

352
00:24:37,904 --> 00:24:41,114
IQ off the chart. He's a loner, no priors.

353
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:42,734
Father split when he was six.

354
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:44,744
Mother was an alcoholic, abusive,

355
00:24:44,864 --> 00:24:47,914
and possibly his first victim.

356
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:49,244
Roberta Perry.

357
00:24:49,784 --> 00:24:52,294
Dental records say she was
the one under the patio.

358
00:24:52,414 --> 00:24:53,754
Neil kept her death quiet

359
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:56,924
by cashing her social security
checks for the last two years,

360
00:24:57,044 --> 00:24:59,424
but he did not kill her for the money.

361
00:25:00,174 --> 00:25:01,174
Morgan?

362
00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:02,964
We think he wanted release.

363
00:25:03,094 --> 00:25:06,934
Roberta Perry ran her son's life,
controlled him, beat him as a kid.

364
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:09,184
He dreamt about killing her for years.

365
00:25:09,304 --> 00:25:12,103
- I spoke with his cellphone provider.
- Can they track his location?

366
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:14,103
No signal. He probably
turned off his phone.

367
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:17,523
But, according to records,
he used it on some of the nights

368
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:20,403
- the victims were taken.
- Who did he call?

369
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,273
Voice mail, checking messages.

370
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:24,283
Verizon triangulated the location.

371
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:28,363
All the calls came from the same place,
a six-block area on Southwest 8th Street.

372
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,453
The Tamiami Trail.
That strip's full of no-tell motels.

373
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,663
It's like a happy hunting ground for hookers.

374
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:36,623
There's a chance that's
where he's killing his victims.

375
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:38,623
Let's recanvass the area for leads.

376
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,123
Now that we've got a photo,

377
00:25:40,253 --> 00:25:42,882
maybe we can find somebody
who actually saw him.

378
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:45,002
Let's go.

379
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:48,012
You're starting to look like her.

380
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:51,802
- Want to check in with your family?
- I'd rather check in with your brother.

381
00:25:51,932 --> 00:25:54,312
His instincts are usually good on this stuff.

382
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,982
Not today. He'd just piss on our parade.
He needs his day off.

383
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:03,192
The first time I saw his work,
I felt like a Spanish explorer

384
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:05,652
landing of the shores of the new world.

385
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:07,992
No blood in the victims,

386
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:10,912
No spatter, no stain.

387
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:14,411
Deb is wrong about him.

388
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:17,161
It's OK. Hell, I've made mistakes.

389
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:21,291
In fact, I'm about to correct
a big one right now.

390
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,421
Jeremy Downs.

391
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:27,881
Hey, you want company?

392
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,881
Just keep walking and looking ahead.

393
00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:34,471
There's some mangroves over by the lake.

394
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:37,681
It's too public. My car's in the parking lot.

395
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:39,061
Are your windows tinted?

396
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,641
I said eyes front.

397
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:46,151
What's wrong?

398
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,030
Shit. Shit.

399
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,870
Get the fuck out of my way!

400
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,410
Take it easy, Jeremy! Stay right there!

401
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,160
Take him down! Take him down!

402
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,460
Hands behind your back.

403
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,670
Stand up! Stand up!

404
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:21,559
Miami Metro PD. Can we have a minute?

405
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,599
- Yeah.
- This guy look familiar?

406
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,059
I don't know.

407
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:27,769
They come. They go. You get it?

408
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:29,439
They "come."

409
00:27:29,569 --> 00:27:32,529
Look, my feet are aching
from pounding the pavement.

410
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:34,239
You think you could help us out?

411
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,279
What's your name?

412
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,369
Lalina...

413
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:52,169
So let's try this again.

414
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:54,509
Have you seen this man?

415
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:59,428
He's a regular. Rents a room
by the month, cash.

416
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,598
- When was he last here?
- He's here now.

417
00:28:01,728 --> 00:28:03,478
He brought a girl to his room.

418
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,938
- A working girl? A hooker?
- All his guests are hookers.

419
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,768
- What's the room number?
- 20. Here's the master.

420
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:12,398
Call for backup.
Let's hope this girl is still alive.

421
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,817
- Do we wait for tactical?
- Not with a possible victim in there.

422
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:32,707
Clear.

423
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,427
It's OK. We're here now. You're safe.

424
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,137
Please get me out!
Hurry, before he comes back!

425
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,307
- Where is he?
- Please, I want to get out!

426
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:46,307
- Where was he going?
- Liquor store.

427
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:48,597
He said he's coming right back.

428
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:53,277
What?

429
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,987
Where's Doakes? He paged me.

430
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:01,327
We need your report
from that kid in the alley.

431
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:05,197
It's my day off. I was at
Don Shula's famous golf course.

432
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,997
Did you finish your report or not?

433
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:08,576
Yeah, it's in my lab.

434
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:11,836
Wait. I'm onto you.

435
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:16,006
Excuse me?

436
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:20,175
Your crazy-ass, knife-slashing
two-step in the alley. You were right.

437
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:23,845
You said the killer
had previous experience, he did.

438
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:25,925
Oh. Really?

439
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,555
Masuka lifted a print from the alley
that matched a kid from juvie.

440
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,225
Cut up a victim five years ago.
Same knife technique.

441
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,645
We just grabbed him at Flamingo Park.

442
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:37,945
Great work, Sergeant.

443
00:29:38,065 --> 00:29:40,195
Your instincts were dead-on.

444
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:43,325
They always are when it
comes to killers, why is that?

445
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:47,115
I'll just go get that report.

446
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:48,615
I'm watching you.

447
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:04,255
Miss me?

448
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,095
Police. On the ground.

449
00:30:06,225 --> 00:30:07,765
Get down slowly.

450
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,604
Get down!

451
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:26,193
I said get the fuck down!

452
00:30:28,613 --> 00:30:30,363
Facedown, let's go!

453
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:42,633
QS, we got one in custody.

454
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,213
What else do you want to put
in the concoction?

455
00:30:46,343 --> 00:30:48,053
Gummy bears.

456
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:51,263
How do you two plan to eat that,
spread it on toast?

457
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:54,013
It already has toast in it.

458
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,973
So it does.

459
00:30:57,393 --> 00:31:00,523
Keep mashing. I'll get the door.

460
00:31:04,313 --> 00:31:05,983
Hey there, big guy.

461
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,533
Dexter, right?

462
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:10,613
Paul, hi. Rita's not here.

463
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,453
That's OK. I'm actually here for the kids.

464
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:15,413
I came to dazzle them with my booty.

465
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:19,293
This booty.

466
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:21,752
This is awkward.

467
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:25,461
I'm afraid I'm not comfortable
letting you inside without Rita here.

468
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:30,171
Who are you, anyway,
like, the baby-sitter?

469
00:31:30,301 --> 00:31:31,841
I'm watching the kids right now,

470
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:35,261
so I suppose that makes me the baby-sitter.

471
00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:41,521
Are you fucking my wife?

472
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:43,691
I'll let Rita know you stopped by.

473
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:46,901
Or I could just walk in. It's my house.

474
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:49,691
I own this place.
I bet she didn't tell you that.

475
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:52,401
Homeowner issues
are way over my head.

476
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:55,281
I should probably call the police,
let them sort this out.

477
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:08,881
Is that it?

478
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:11,761
Yeah.

479
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:16,511
Why don't you give those presents
to my little buckets of sunshine,

480
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:19,351
tell Rita she can reach me
at the motor court?

481
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:20,471
OK.

482
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:25,020
He might be a crack-addled,
wife-abusing yahoo,

483
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,190
but he refuses to abandon his kids.

484
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,650
I'm not sure that's a good thing.

485
00:32:39,869 --> 00:32:42,119
- Take him in, I'll be right there.
- You got it.

486
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:44,539
Congratulations.

487
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:47,919
You brought down the most notorious
serial killer in Florida history.

488
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:51,499
Fuckin'-A.
He's in booking right now.

489
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:55,049
It sucks you weren't a part of this.

490
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:57,549
You and me, we paved
the way for this, right?

491
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,299
I'm cool. I've got my own bad guy.

492
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,389
I just picked up a message from Tony Tucci.

493
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,649
Our favorite fun-loving amputee's
getting out of the hospital.

494
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:09,059
There's a party tonight.

495
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:11,229
- No, thanks.
- I don't want to go either,

496
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:14,399
but he lost body parts, and we
can tell him we caught the guy.

497
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,239
- What else you got going on?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

498
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:20,909
There'll be hookers there.

499
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:21,949
All right.

500
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,408
Fine, Mr. Grumpyhead. Have it your way.

501
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:29,378
Did he threaten you?

502
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:31,288
No. Nothing like that.

503
00:33:31,418 --> 00:33:34,128
He was just marking his territory.

504
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:35,878
Fucking bastard.

505
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,798
Only you could make those words cute.

506
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:41,887
Stop it.

507
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,937
Paul said he owns this house. Is that true?

508
00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:49,897
Yeah. Yeah.

509
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:53,227
He had it before we met.
I think he got it in a drug trade.

510
00:33:57,197 --> 00:34:00,407
- Dex, what am I gonna do?
- I'd start by getting a divorce.

511
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:05,037
God, this is such a mess,
and I've dragged you into it.

512
00:34:07,077 --> 00:34:09,917
There, there.

513
00:34:10,037 --> 00:34:12,747
I just wish he'd go away.

514
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:15,757
Why can't he just go away
and disappear forever?

515
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:19,087
He can do that...

516
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:21,797
very easily.

517
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:58,455
Fuck.

518
00:35:01,635 --> 00:35:04,635
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

519
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:08,095
Just let me grab my heart up
off the fucking floor.

520
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:10,055
Holy fuck, Rita.

521
00:35:11,185 --> 00:35:12,975
Come on in.

522
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:14,185
No.

523
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:15,645
No, I'm good right here.

524
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:18,275
Oh, come on.

525
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:19,855
Don't be that way.
Come on in.

526
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,735
I got a six-pack in the cooler.

527
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:23,355
No.

528
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:26,485
No more.

529
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:28,574
What?

530
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:31,654
No more surprise visits to the house,

531
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,454
no more intimidating my friends,

532
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:35,624
and especially no more Disney-dad.

533
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:37,834
You lost your right to be a father

534
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:40,874
when you beat your children's mother.

535
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:45,174
If you want to get to know Astor and Cody,
you'll have to work for that privilege.

536
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:48,004
- Can I get a word in here, please?
- No.

537
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:51,474
Divorce papers.

538
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:54,134
They're the ones you refused
to sign in prison.

539
00:35:54,264 --> 00:35:57,564
Sign them now, and I'll agree
to supervised visits twice a week.

540
00:35:57,854 --> 00:36:00,813
Show me you can do that for
six months, and then maybe -

541
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:03,893
maybe - I'll think about
a non-supervised schedule.

542
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,693
Is this some kind of joke, Rita?

543
00:36:09,323 --> 00:36:11,533
You think you can really
make me back down?

544
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:14,323
No, I don't.

545
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:16,703
But what else am I gonna do, Paul?

546
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:19,243
A judge put me in control.

547
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:22,123
I'm in control now, and I have the power

548
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:24,463
to make sure you never see
your children again

549
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,833
unless you do exactly as I tell you.

550
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:31,922
Goddamn, you are fine when you're mad.

551
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:34,262
I love the new you.

552
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:37,762
I do. My ass is yours to kick.

553
00:36:37,892 --> 00:36:40,102
I deserve it. Here, look.

554
00:36:40,222 --> 00:36:42,932
Rita, I am a changed man,

555
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:47,402
and I swear to God,
I am going to prove it to you.

556
00:36:50,572 --> 00:36:52,072
All right. There she is.

557
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:56,572
Anybody bring any popcorn?

558
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:02,832
You got him.

559
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:08,291
Both of them.

560
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:12,051
- Where's Perry's lawyer?
- He waived the right.

561
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:15,971
I can't hear a thing.
Who's got the remote?

562
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:20,681
There they are, my two colleagues...

563
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:24,771
technically speaking.

564
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:27,981
Thankfully, one of them's a fraud.

565
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:29,861
...because you assume that.

566
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,940
So you can assume I killed them.
You can assume anything you want.

567
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,820
The doer is merely a fiction

568
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,870
that's added to the deed - the deed.

569
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,990
The deed is everything.

570
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,210
At least I hope he's a fraud.

571
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,130
Here's to my new hand.

572
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,970
Some say bravery

573
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,470
is being the only one
who knows you're afraid.

574
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,180
But I've worked with
a lot of amputees,

575
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,310
and I got to say, I don't think
Tony knew he was afraid.

576
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,980
Here's to one crazy bastard.

577
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,270
Kiss my atrophied ass.

578
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,230
- Now for the main event.
- Medical marijuana?

579
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:19,029
You wish.

580
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:21,819
Can you help me out here, Rudy?

581
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:28,369
Look at that shit.
Half-human, half-machine.

582
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:30,169
But all man, baby.

583
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:36,168
I got it.

584
00:38:40,048 --> 00:38:41,588
Yeah.

585
00:38:43,258 --> 00:38:44,348
May I have this dance?

586
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:46,428
You might have
a chance with me, after all.

587
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:49,688
Don't worry, there's still
plenty of me to go around.

588
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:56,398
So, you made that hand and foot?

589
00:38:57,148 --> 00:38:59,068
You did a good thing.

590
00:38:59,198 --> 00:39:03,568
Tony lost a piece of himself,
and I helped him find it.

591
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:08,408
How often in life do you
get to make someone whole?

592
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:09,958
I wouldn't know.

593
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:12,418
It's like living art, what you do.

594
00:39:12,538 --> 00:39:16,378
It's funny you should say that,
because before I turned to prosthetics,

595
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:20,918
I studied the human form
at the university of Paris - Sorbonne.

596
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,798
- Really?
- Yeah.

597
00:39:25,887 --> 00:39:28,387
- Have you had dinner yet?
- I would love to.

598
00:39:30,687 --> 00:39:33,057
I thought I'd come and show my support.

599
00:39:33,477 --> 00:39:34,646
Bad timing?

600
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:36,726
No. No.

601
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:38,646
Have some champagne, Sergeant.

602
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,946
See, we got blogs.

603
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:47,576
We got podcasts.

604
00:39:47,696 --> 00:39:49,446
The information won't stop.

605
00:39:49,576 --> 00:39:51,956
It comes into your head
and bleeds out your eyes,

606
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:55,166
and it's all crap, you know?

607
00:39:55,286 --> 00:39:59,126
See, you got to dare
for greatness these days

608
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:00,756
to get people's attention.

609
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:06,346
Did I get yours?

610
00:40:14,096 --> 00:40:17,646
This is worse than foreplay.
Why doesn't she ask him questions?

611
00:40:17,766 --> 00:40:21,316
I have no idea what she's doing,
but my patience is wearing thin.

612
00:40:24,526 --> 00:40:27,406
I gave Jeremy a chance, and he blew it.

613
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:31,946
Is this one going to disappoint me too?

614
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:37,414
That's an interesting interview technique.

615
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:41,504
I'm tired of asking questions.
You're getting off on this too fucking much.

616
00:40:42,754 --> 00:40:45,214
- Getting off on what?
- The game.

617
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:47,884
I guess that's why
you didn't request a lawyer.

618
00:40:48,004 --> 00:40:50,844
So you can sit here and say
whatever comes into your head.

619
00:40:50,964 --> 00:40:52,884
While my ass is spreading like Cheez Whiz,

620
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:56,394
waiting for you to figure out
this isn't the fun part.

621
00:40:56,514 --> 00:40:58,224
What are you talking about?

622
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:03,144
We got you dead to rights.

623
00:41:04,234 --> 00:41:08,024
But the good times won't start rolling
till you're in a courtroom

624
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:10,524
with your own personal Judge Ito,

625
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:14,574
and Court TV
carrying your scary-ass scowls

626
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:17,574
and crazy shit live.

627
00:41:17,704 --> 00:41:20,584
Fascination with serial killers
is an American pastime.

628
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:22,204
You got groupie housewives,

629
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:25,044
magazine profiles,

630
00:41:25,174 --> 00:41:28,214
maybe even a summer
blockbuster movie...

631
00:41:28,334 --> 00:41:29,884
all waiting for you.

632
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:35,174
But the feeding frenzy won't start
till you throw out the chum.

633
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:38,393
So now I'm just gonna chill.

634
00:41:42,182 --> 00:41:43,852
You're right.

635
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,102
This isn't the fun part.

636
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:55,442
The fun part...

637
00:41:55,572 --> 00:41:58,822
- was hanging them like cattle.
- Hanging who?

638
00:42:02,372 --> 00:42:03,832
The hookers...

639
00:42:03,952 --> 00:42:05,622
right before I cut their throats.

640
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:07,752
Son of a bitch.

641
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:10,132
I used gravity boots
to hang them upside down

642
00:42:10,252 --> 00:42:11,792
to drain the blood.

643
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:12,842
Then...

644
00:42:12,962 --> 00:42:14,092
That shit is privileged.

645
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:17,222
- The press never got ahold of that.
- I dipped them in liquid nitrogen

646
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:22,512
to freeze the blood before I cut them
into nice, clean pieces.

647
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:23,932
Yes.

648
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:26,892
See, you got to understand...
I hate blood.

649
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:30,272
And there it is.

650
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:32,942
All the expectations I had,

651
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:37,112
all the promises of greatness wiped out.

652
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:40,911
My circle of friends is down to one.

653
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:51,790
How... What are you doing here?
Are you a cop?

654
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,420
The cameras are off.
I have one minute.

655
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,510
Tell me why. I need to know.

656
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:59,800
- Why what?
- Don't!

657
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,100
You killed again.
I told you, I warned you...

658
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,930
Don't kill anyone
who doesn't deserve to die.

659
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
Why did you do it?

660
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:14,980
To feel something different.

661
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,780
Different than what?

662
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,410
What do you normally feel?

663
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,960
Nothing.

664
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,330
Fucking nothing at all.

665
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,050
I hate every fucking goddamn second of it.

666
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,260
I can't stand it, living my life in my head.

667
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:58,148
Does killing make it better?

668
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:02,318
No.

669
00:44:03,158 --> 00:44:04,738
Worse.

670
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:07,158
Fucking worse than ever.

671
00:44:09,828 --> 00:44:11,868
Put your hands on the table.

672
00:44:13,668 --> 00:44:14,708
Do it.

673
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:22,628
I'm a lot like you, you know?

674
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:25,548
Yeah, right. You're a killer?

675
00:44:30,098 --> 00:44:32,098
I'm empty...

676
00:44:35,558 --> 00:44:39,688
but I found a way to make it feel
less bottomless.

677
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:45,357
How?

678
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:47,157
Pretend.

679
00:44:47,827 --> 00:44:50,367
You pretend the feelings
are there for the world,

680
00:44:51,117 --> 00:44:53,407
and for the people around you.

681
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:58,417
Who knows?
Maybe one day they will be.

682
00:44:58,537 --> 00:44:59,917
What the hell are you doing?

683
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:01,837
Scraping under the nails for blood.

684
00:45:01,957 --> 00:45:03,087
Get out.

685
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:07,716
I want ten more minutes with this piece
of shit before his lawyer shows.

686
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:12,056
Stand up!

687
00:45:12,886 --> 00:45:14,766
Living my life in my head...

688
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:17,436
I know exactly what Jeremy means.

689
00:45:17,556 --> 00:45:22,146
At least I had someone to talk to -
Harry, my foster father.

690
00:45:22,276 --> 00:45:25,736
He spent endless hours
teaching me how to survive.

691
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,906
Excuse me, are you
Jeremy Downs' lawyer?

692
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:30,026
Yes. I'm just heading over to see him.

693
00:45:30,156 --> 00:45:31,616
Sooner would be better.

694
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:35,576
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

695
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:47,375
My mom died when I was 16, cancer,

696
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:50,755
and then it was just me,
my brother, my dad.

697
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:53,765
- You have a brother?
- Yeah. Dexter.

698
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:56,555
He and my dad were really tight.

699
00:45:56,685 --> 00:46:00,975
They were always spending time together.
I guess I was jealous.

700
00:46:01,765 --> 00:46:03,855
You mean you weren't daddy's little girl?

701
00:46:03,985 --> 00:46:06,395
No, I was, kind of.

702
00:46:06,525 --> 00:46:09,485
He just took a special interest
in Dex, you know?

703
00:46:09,615 --> 00:46:12,945
I think that's why I became a cop.
That's what he was.

704
00:46:13,075 --> 00:46:15,654
I thought maybe he would give me
more attention.

705
00:46:15,784 --> 00:46:17,614
And did he?

706
00:46:17,744 --> 00:46:19,614
Not really...

707
00:46:20,204 --> 00:46:23,494
but we had our moments.

708
00:46:23,624 --> 00:46:27,334
What about you?
How'd you become...

709
00:46:27,464 --> 00:46:29,424
Captain Hook?

710
00:46:30,504 --> 00:46:33,674
Well, when I was little,
my mom got in a car accident,

711
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,804
and she lost both her legs.

712
00:46:37,134 --> 00:46:38,134
That's terrible.

713
00:46:39,594 --> 00:46:41,724
I remember when it happened,

714
00:46:41,854 --> 00:46:45,104
I just wanted to put her back together,

715
00:46:45,224 --> 00:46:47,483
you know, like Humpty Dumpty.

716
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:51,233
Just the pieces weren't around.

717
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:19,383
I'm going to miss my playmate.

718
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:27,182
Sure, there's Rita and the kids,
but they don't know the real me...

719
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,562
can never know the real me.

720
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:34,612
And now the father is back.

721
00:47:37,032 --> 00:47:39,192
Things have changed.

722
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,492
Everything has changed.

723
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:49,581
I always prided myself on being an outsider,

724
00:47:49,711 --> 00:47:51,711
but now...

725
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:57,211
I feel the need to connect with someone.

726
00:48:02,391 --> 00:48:04,431
I saw myself in Jeremy...

727
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:07,721
but instead of helping him
like Harry helped me,

728
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:12,141
I gave him a piece of fortune-cookie advice
that he never even heard.

729
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:13,941
I failed him.

730
00:48:15,441 --> 00:48:18,111
He deserves better...

731
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:20,571
and he'll get it from now on.

732
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
I guess I was wrong.

733
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,679
Jeremy did hear my advice.

734
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,769
He killed someone who deserved to die.

735
00:48:56,439 --> 00:48:59,479
- What's the status on Perry?
- I'm having him transferred right now.

736
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:03,609
The DA wants to keep him at County,
pending arraignment.

737
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:07,659
Maria, it was your decision making

738
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:11,369
that led to his capture and arrest,

739
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:14,999
and you made all our lives easier
by getting the bastard to confess.

740
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,289
I'm just doing my job.

741
00:49:17,419 --> 00:49:22,339
It feels good to be praising your police work
instead of your politics for a change.

742
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:28,599
We need to make an official comment. Don't
worry. I'll keep it short.

743
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,009
I'm heading downstairs
for the press conference.

744
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:33,309
The press conference is over.

745
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,599
Oh, and don't worry.

746
00:49:35,729 --> 00:49:37,939
I kept it short.

747
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:40,108
You got to be fucking kidding me.

748
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:41,978
That was my bust.

749
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:43,488
This is my department.

750
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,698
Did you at least give me credit?

751
00:49:49,828 --> 00:49:53,787
Yes. I just gave it to you.
Haven't you been listening?

752
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:04,587
Ever since Harry's death, I've been alone...

753
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,597
but now, for the first time...

754
00:50:12,257 --> 00:50:13,887
I feel alone.

755
00:50:14,017 --> 00:50:16,887
How long you need
with the prisoner?

756
00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:23,067
As long as I can get.

757
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:24,397
Jeremy is gone,

758
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:28,567
and Neil Perry will soon vanish
into the catacombs of the system.

759
00:50:29,617 --> 00:50:32,947
I have so many questions for him.

760
00:50:33,077 --> 00:50:36,077
How did he discover my secrets?

761
00:50:36,207 --> 00:50:37,997
What was his message to me?

762
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:42,537
He's been in my home,

763
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:46,547
my photos... my life.

764
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,876
He knows me.

765
00:50:50,636 --> 00:50:53,555
Now I need to know him...

766
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:02,605
...to connect face-to-face

767
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:05,565
before he's beyond my reach forever.

768
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:19,575
Hi.

769
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,872
Who the fuck are you?
