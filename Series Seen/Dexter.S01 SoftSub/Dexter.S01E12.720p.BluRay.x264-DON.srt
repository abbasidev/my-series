1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,710
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,420
I got here as fast as I could.
What are we looking at?

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,420
Female victim cut up into pieces.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,090
The ice-truck killer? So soon?

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,390
This is what he wanted me to find all along.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,350
Laura Moser...

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,230
My mother.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,100
Laura Moser and three others
found chopped up with a chainsaw.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,980
Your father was a decent man
and an honest cop,

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,530
but what he saw in that
cargo container changed him.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,070
You think it's the attacker's blood?

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,620
We know Batista fought back.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,120
The samples were a match.
They're from the same person.

14
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,870
So if you or that bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,130
I swear to God,
I don't care who I have to hurt.

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,130
Let's face it, Paul.
You've been a problem.

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,380
I need you to explain
to them why you're here.

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,430
I have no fucking idea
why I'm in this place.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,220
You really don't want to do this.

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,140
Effective immediately,
you will no longer serve as my Lieutenant.

21
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,100
This isn't fucking over, Tom!

22
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,100
Debra Morgan...

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,110
will you marry me?

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,570
Yes, yes, yes.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,240
Where's my sister?

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,820
Took her Code 12.
Left about an hour ago.

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,120
She wasn't supposed to go anywhere.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,580
You made it easy.

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,250
So desperate to fall in love.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,370
Where the fuck are you?

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,790
I'm at work and you're not.
I need to talk to you.

32
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,340
Do not see Rudy until you find me.

33
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,720
I've lived in darkness a long time.

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
Over the years, my eyes adjusted

35
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,060
until the dark became my world
and I could see.

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,190
But then Rudy turned on the light.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,070
He flooded my memory, and now I'm blind.

38
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,120
I don't have much time.

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,370
To be more accurate,
my sister doesn't have much time.

40
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,290
He wants me to find him,
but where do I look?

41
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,420
I can't think. It's too bright.

42
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,800
Let me know if the tape's too tight.

43
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,220
There's no need for you to be uncomfortable.

44
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,180
Why are you doing this?

45
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,970
Who am I to spoil the surprise?

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,560
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

47
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,060
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

48
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,230
I'm just checking the supplies, OK?

49
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,610
Things are moving faster
than I had planned.

50
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,530
- This isn't you.
- Pretty sure it is.

51
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,490
No.

52
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,370
I know there's more. I've seen it.

53
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,120
I never wanted to hurt you.

54
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,460
I know. I know.

55
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,760
Does this make it easier for you?
'Cause I can keep going.

56
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,590
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

57
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,430
Oh, Jesus Christ!

58
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,850
There's nothing to be ashamed of, Deb.

59
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,720
You're not the only one who bought it.

60
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,600
Your name isn't even fucking
Rudy Cooper, is it?

61
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,690
- Nope. But he died for a good cause.
- Yeah, well, so will you.

62
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,490
You kidnapped a cop this time, you know?

63
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,570
Not some invisible hooker.
You kidnapped a cop.

64
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,080
It's all part of the plan.

65
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,870
Jesus.

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,040
It's hard to believe
it's almost come to fruition.

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,380
I mean, this is a lot of years
in the making.

68
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,840
We're only hours away.

69
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,840
He wouldn't have taken Deb

70
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,760
unless he left me everything
a clever monster would need

71
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,430
in order to find them.

72
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,310
Seems I have a new screen saver.

73
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,990
I knew he wouldn't leave me stranded,
but Born Free?

74
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,080
Of course.

75
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,580
Thanks to Rudy, now I know
where dearly disturbed Dexter was born.

76
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,760
Born free of all that's human.

77
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,260
That's where I'll find him.

78
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,790
She knows.

79
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,170
She knows. She knows.

80
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,140
She knows. She knows.
She knows. She knows.

81
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,300
She knows. She knows.

82
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,850
All fucking night with that.

83
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,600
She knows.

84
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,020
Listen, we need your help.

85
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,440
Masuka says you were following up a lead

86
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,850
on the ice-truck killer
when you were attacked.

87
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,810
A hooker with a prosthetic hand.

88
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,980
John painted her nails different colors,
but it didn't go nowhere.

89
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,990
Except she was just cut up
by the ice-truck killer.

90
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,740
Holy shit. Monique was a victim?

91
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,490
We're operating on the theory
that he found out you were on his trail.

92
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,500
If we're right, that means
you got stabbed for a reason.

93
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,210
No one knew what I was doing
except Masuka.

94
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,170
Someone else had to know. Think.

95
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,010
I consulted with Rudy, Debra's boyfriend,
the prosthetics guy.

96
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,050
But that's crazy, right?

97
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,100
She's been AWOL
since she went to meet him.

98
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,810
She was supposed to come back
and help me canvass,

99
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,180
but she never made it.

100
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,600
That's not like her. Angel, we got to go.

101
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,190
Go. Just go.

102
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,410
There are about 5,000 cargo containers
in the port of Miami.

103
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,790
Finding the one where my mother
was butchered took a bit of magic.

104
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,710
Presto.

105
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,390
Shit.

106
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,390
Just a second!

107
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,910
I told you he was here.

108
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,200
There some reason you're not
answering your damn phone?

109
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,450
Ambien.

110
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,540
What happened here, Dexter?

111
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,620
I couldn't find the remote.

112
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,460
Where's your sister?
She didn't come to work,

113
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,130
and she's not at her apartment.

114
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,300
I honestly don't know, Sergeant.

115
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,970
Dexter, we think her boyfriend
is connected to the ice-truck killer.

116
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,140
We're working on getting
a search warrant to search his home.

117
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,640
Oh, my. No, wow.

118
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,140
Cut the crap.

119
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,480
- You know something. What?
- James.

120
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,480
I saw him last night, skulking in the lab,
ordering secret blood tests.

121
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,280
What kind of tests?

122
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,120
I was looking for a match
on the blood on Batista's collar.

123
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,280
And whose was it?

124
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,580
Rudy's.

125
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,830
Motherfucker.

126
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,120
Knock it off!

127
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,290
He knew all along!

128
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,130
Rudy lied about a cut on his lip.
Angel headbutted his attacker in the face.

129
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,340
- It was just a hunch.
- Why didn't you tell us?

130
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,800
I couldn't destroy
Deb's love life on a hunch.

131
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,050
I had to get the facts.

132
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,010
Here are the facts. If he kills her, it's your fault.

133
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,060
What else do you know?

134
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,850
That's it.

135
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,310
He's lying.

136
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,190
Give him a break, James.
It's his sister, all right?

137
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,360
If he knows what's good for her,
he'll stay home

138
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,820
and answer the fucking phone when it rings.

139
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,200
Call if you hear anything.

140
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,710
Hello?

141
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,050
Please don't hang up.

142
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,300
Paul?

143
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,590
The kids don't want to talk to you, OK?

144
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,010
Give them more time.

145
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,100
This isn't about them.
It's about how I was arrested.

146
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,810
Yeah, with a needle in your arm.

147
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,060
I know all about it.

148
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,730
Well, I don't.

149
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,230
I take responsibility for all the shit I pull,

150
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,570
but Rita, I was in the program.

151
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,070
I kicked the hard stuff.

152
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,440
Well, apparently not.

153
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,410
I was clean. I swear on my kids' lives.

154
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,070
It's been driving me nuts.

155
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,490
How I got from your house one minute
to the motel room the next,

156
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,580
completely out of my mind on junk.

157
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,460
- It's called a blackout.
- It's called a set-up.

158
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,460
Last thing I remember,

159
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,000
was standing
in the kitchen, talking to Dexter.

160
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,550
Maybe he smacked me on the head

161
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:02,510
and dragged me out of the house,
through the backyard.

162
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,880
You're a piece of work.

163
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,720
I'm telling you,
Dexter is not who you think he is.

164
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,220
Hello?

165
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,400
Make sure it's distributed to everyone, OK?

166
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,230
OK, his name is Rudy Cooper.

167
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,860
Some of you may have met him.
He was dating Officer Morgan.

168
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,990
She was last seen 16 hours ago,

169
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,820
driving to meet him
at the Miami Beach marina.

170
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,700
We need to canvass the entire area.

171
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,160
Check boat rentals. You guys know the drill.

172
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,290
I've sent a team
to his prosthetics lab at the hospital.

173
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,040
The judge just signed off on
the warrant for Cooper's apartment.

174
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,250
Let's tear that place apart.

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,340
Jake, Sergio, Kim, you guys are with me.

176
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,970
Your attention, please.

177
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,890
I want to introduce you to
our new lieutenant, EsmÃ© Pascal.

178
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,350
She agreed to put her vacation on hold,

179
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,140
to provide us with much-needed leadership
at this critical time.

180
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,480
Lieutenant, you're on.

181
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,150
I understand we have a new suspect
in the ice-truck killer case.

182
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,480
We're on our way over now
to search his place.

183
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,320
And you are...

184
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,320
Maria LaGuerta.

185
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,700
An officer is missing,
so we need to move fast.

186
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,120
I thought that Sergeant Doakes
was running that investigation.

187
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,040
- He's out following a lead.
- What lead?

188
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,910
He said he'd let me know
if it came to anything.

189
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,040
I'll take it over from here. Thank you, Maria.

190
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,340
Who can get me up to speed on the way over?

191
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,510
I can, I guess.

192
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,170
You're driving.

193
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,640
Feel free to join us
when you locate your partner.

194
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,260
Would you like to come with us, Captain?

195
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,020
You seem to have everything under control.

196
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,810
Let's go, people.

197
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,160
It's in there somewhere, my birthplace.

198
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,670
Now what?

199
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,300
No cameras, no patrols, no dogs.

200
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,430
With billions spent on homeland security,
it can't be as easy as a couple of snips.

201
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,690
So much for the war on terror.

202
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,420
Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when
every straw is computerized.

203
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,440
Reefer yard, plug 4-3-6.

204
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,280
I don't like this place.

205
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,900
Something nameless was born here...

206
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,660
Something that lives
in the deepest, darkest hole

207
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,410
of the thing called Dexter.

208
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,550
Get in there!

209
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,600
Somebody else, get in there now!

210
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,060
It's all right, little guy. You're safe now.

211
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,770
Nothing will hurt you. I promise.

212
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,600
OK, Deb...

213
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,180
Don't be dead.

214
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,480
Shit.

215
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,690
Surprise, motherfucker.

216
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,200
- Are you following me now?
- You better have a reason for being here.

217
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
- I'm looking for my sister.
- In a cargo box?

218
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,620
Yeah, I'm kind of working on a theory.

219
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,830
You forget you work for the cops?
We love theories.

220
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,540
Spin me a story, asshole.

221
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,870
- What I do on my time is my business.
- Me too, and I'm on my time now.

222
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,710
There's no lieutenant here to save your ass, so
don't fuck with me, Morgan!

223
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,300
All right, you got me.

224
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,760
I ordered some furniture from Thailand.
I was waiting for it to be delivered.

225
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,480
Lab geek my ass.

226
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,060
What the hell's going on?

227
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,610
Security, I need somebody
down here right now.

228
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,730
Miami Metro PD.

229
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,070
Is this guy under arrest?

230
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,530
That's a good question.

231
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,070
You're connected to this.
I don't know how, but I'm gonna find out,

232
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,030
and what I find is gonna stick to you.

233
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,470
Let me out of here, asshole!

234
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,140
Let me out! Let me out!

235
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,520
Let me out, you piece of shit!

236
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,400
Let me out of here, you fucker!

237
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,110
Fuck! Let me out!

238
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,320
Sorry, but you were drowning out Fred's radio,

239
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,620
and he was kind enough to lend us his wheels.

240
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,290
Don't do it!

241
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Bye!

242
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,140
His happy place,
where he kills more than time.

243
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,600
This is where he'd leave me a clue.

244
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,060
Dexter, better bundle up.

245
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,360
I like the cold.

246
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,030
You know, hypothermia
can easily sneak up on you.

247
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,030
So can hypochondria.

248
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,700
A home like this
would take years to put together.

249
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,990
He must have hated leaving it behind.

250
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,410
What are you looking for?

251
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,620
A clue. A signature or a calling card.

252
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,580
Anything that might give us
a sense of where he went.

253
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,250
I don't think he was
thinking about us when he did this.

254
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
I mean, look at this place.

255
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,050
You were right about the victim.
He rushed his work.

256
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,550
He killed that girl to keep us
busy so he could escape,

257
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,350
but he wouldn't go without
leaving a message.

258
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,890
We just need to find it.

259
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,140
Check this out.

260
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,350
This is where he played with his meat.

261
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,440
Pretty whacked out.

262
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,400
I can think of 101 uses for this table.

263
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,070
Know what I mean?

264
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,660
He has my sister, Vince.

265
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,530
Right. I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

266
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,580
Shit.

267
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,410
You're Karen, right?

268
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,500
That's right.

269
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,500
You're in charge of evidence.
This entire room, evidence.

270
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,590
Take photos of every item
in its original position.

271
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,050
Show me the inventory list
when you're done.

272
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,430
Is he in charge?

273
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,010
Guess he is now.

274
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,770
Hi. I'm Bob Hicks.

275
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,860
Can I help you?

276
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,150
I guess Paul never mentioned me.

277
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,610
I'm his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor.

278
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,950
Right.

279
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,950
So, having your sponsor do your dirty work,

280
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,870
which step is that?

281
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,750
He's just concerned for the kids.

282
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,370
No, he's concerned for himself. Excuse me...

283
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,040
I thought he was lying, too,
until I saw the proof.

284
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,170
What proof?

285
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,800
Well, the X-rays the prison
doctor took of Paul's head.

286
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,550
They showed a skull fracture.

287
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,800
Yeah, which I deservedly gave him.

288
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,010
No. You didn't.

289
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,640
After you struck him,
the hospital took X-rays, no fracture.

290
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,770
But in prison, a fracture.

291
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,150
If you know Paul,
he'd bash his head against the wall

292
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,480
to get what he wants.

293
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,570
I do know Paul. I think I know him pretty well.

294
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,160
No, listen, if Paul was attacked,

295
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,160
the way that it happened,
that takes expertise, skill.

296
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,410
No first-timer is gonna be able to pull that off.

297
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,620
Which is why his accusations are ludicrous.

298
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,380
Dexter spends all his time
in a laboratory, for God's sake.

299
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,460
So you've been there?

300
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,720
You seem like a nice man,

301
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,180
but this is none of your goddamn business.

302
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,220
OK. Got it.

303
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,180
We traced the social of Rudy Cooper

304
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:56,390
to a New Jersey plumber
who mysteriously died in '98.

305
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,560
You got to be kidding.

306
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,020
We still don't have an ID on this guy?

307
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,440
Rudy isn't his real name?

308
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,400
- You trying to be smart?
- Not trying, no.

309
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,740
If you know his name...

310
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,660
Whatever it is going on
between you two, it ends now.

311
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,200
What did you find in there?

312
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,790
Other than the obvious,
a lot of trace bloodstains.

313
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,880
It's probably where he killed them all.

314
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,170
I'd like to look at the rest of the apartment.

315
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,880
Yeah, OK.

316
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,560
- You mind if I...
- Be my guest.

317
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,980
It's perfect. Right out in the open.

318
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,200
At least he's consistent.

319
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,450
Was there anything else near this?

320
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,080
Yeah, a fucking doll sitting on top.

321
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,250
"Home sweet home."

322
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,420
Is he taking me back before the blood,
to a place where a boy was born?

323
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,550
Home sweet home, but which home?

324
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,440
Down on the floor, please.

325
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,950
It's kind of foolish, Deb.

326
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,830
I don't usually work this way.

327
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,250
Call it an homage to a fellow
traveler I greatly admire.

328
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,810
Laura Moser.

329
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,730
Addict, dealer.

330
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,890
My mother.

331
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,810
Arrested in '69, again in '71.

332
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,270
Same address listed both times.

333
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,780
1235 Mangrove Drive.

334
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,820
They say home is where the heart is.

335
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,280
Maybe this is where I left mine.

336
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,740
Surprise.

337
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,040
What are you doing here?

338
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,330
White-chocolate mocha. Your favorite.

339
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,460
I'm gonna have to drink it on the road.

340
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,590
I've never even been here before.
I'd love a tour sometime.

341
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,260
Sometime that's not now.

342
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,170
Dexter, what's going on?

343
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,010
It's Deb, OK? She's in trouble.

344
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,800
God. Is it serious?

345
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,720
Yeah, actually, it's very serious,

346
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,810
but I just can't worry
about you, too, right now.

347
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,530
She knows.

348
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:54,200
The notorious ice-truck killer,

349
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,360
whose been leaving a trail of dead bodies.

350
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,580
Authorities say their big break came
when they found a video of his latest victim.

351
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,370
If she knows, you yapping
about it ain't gonna change it.

352
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,540
The suspect is operating
under an alias, "Rudy Cooper."

353
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,880
We didn't have his fingerprints
in our database,

354
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,710
so his identity is still unclear to us.

355
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,050
She knows.

356
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,970
So sorry, Mr. Batista.

357
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,600
We had to take the psych
overflow from County,

358
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,050
but this one's harmless.

359
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,560
Don't be so sure.

360
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,390
We never take the violent ones.

361
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,770
They have the arsonists, the rapists,

362
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
the psycho killers over there.

363
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,690
I tell you, those people belong in prison.

364
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,950
Do they fingerprint
psych patients at County?

365
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,160
Yes, of course.

366
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,160
Half of them don't know their own names.

367
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,740
Got to ID them somehow.

368
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,870
That should take care of him.
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

369
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,590
ID Tech.

370
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,180
It's Batista. Can you do me a favor?

371
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,010
I need you to run Rudy Cooper's prints

372
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,430
against psych, mental, and institution records.

373
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,820
Where are you, you silly little bear?

374
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,950
I'm going to find you!

375
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,990
Where can you be?

376
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
You silly little goose.

377
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,620
I'm gonna find you!

378
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,870
You silly bear. Where is my baby?

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,540
Where is my Dexter? Where are you?

380
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,800
- Where's my Dexter?
- Here!

381
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,840
Oh, my goodness, yes!

382
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,010
You surprised me, you stinky little bear.

383
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,010
Hey, where could your brother be hiding?

384
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,390
Bynie's right there.

385
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,110
Hey, Bynie.

386
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,190
You weren't supposed to tell her.

387
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,240
You remember now?

388
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,450
Bynie.

389
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,700
You always had trouble saying Brian.

390
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,960
I have a brother.

391
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,580
A real brother.

392
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,670
None of this foster bullshit.

393
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,220
We're blood brothers, through birth and death.

394
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,550
Watching mom die,

395
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,100
it's amazing that we survived that, isn't it?

396
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,190
The chainsaw, the flying body parts,

397
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,520
the blood.

398
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,240
You were there, too.

399
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,540
Two days sitting in blood
before they found us,

400
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,790
but you were young enough to block it out.

401
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,800
I've never forgotten the day that we were...

402
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,090
Born.

403
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,550
Exactly.

404
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,930
Where's Deb?

405
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,640
I waited for you before we got started.

406
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,100
- Debra!
- She's not in here.

407
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,440
This is not the way
I envisioned our family reunion.

408
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,740
Come on, let's just sit down
and have a beer.

409
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,410
That was the best wipeout.

410
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,960
You didn't even cry.

411
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,670
Next time you try my skateboard,
bend your knees, OK?

412
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,710
Hi.

413
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,590
Hi.

414
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,590
Look out!

415
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,100
I didn't want to do it this way.

416
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,900
OK, let's run his description
against Interpol's fugitive list,

417
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,280
in case he isn't American.

418
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,620
Rudy Cooper? His real name is Brian Moser.

419
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,700
What the hell are you doing here?

420
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,490
I got a hit on his prints

421
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,500
from a Tampa mental hospital
where he grew up.

422
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,750
He was institutionalized for
antisocial personality disorder.

423
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,260
At 21, they said he was cured.
They released him.

424
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,260
Run the name Brian Moser
for credit cards, bank accounts,

425
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,260
anything that might tell us
where he's got Morgan.

426
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,560
We've triangulated
Officer Morgan's cellphone.

427
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,180
Last known location,
20 miles off the coast,

428
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,890
which means he's got her on a boat.

429
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,980
We have his real name.
We're digging into his records.

430
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,530
His name's not gonna help us
find him in open water.

431
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,690
Coordinated search with the coast guard.

432
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,360
- Waste of time.
- Chain of command.

433
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,700
Flyovers, helicopters, whatever it takes.

434
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,490
That signal died last night.

435
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,120
By now, he has most likely taken
her to his final location.

436
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,410
Noted.

437
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,290
Let's get busy, people.

438
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,340
Flyovers look good to the press,
but they won't find Morgan.

439
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,970
You think the press matters to me?

440
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,850
It matters to Captain Matthews,
and he calls the shots.

441
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,140
I know you need to define yourself here

442
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,390
and putting me in my place
is one way to do that,

443
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,100
but one of our own is missing,

444
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,360
and we shouldn't waste our time
pissing on trees.

445
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,730
I agree.

446
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,940
I can also see why you were reassigned,

447
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,570
and it has nothing to do
with incompetence

448
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,030
and everything to do with
the Captain trying to save his job.

449
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,870
OK.

450
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,210
Now, I was hired with the directive
to not make your life easy.

451
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,040
So you're gonna ignore the lead?

452
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,470
You don't know me very well,

453
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:34,390
but luckily for Officer Morgan,
neither does the Captain.

454
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,900
Nothing personal.

455
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,280
I just wanted to have a beer
with you before we got started.

456
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,320
You made that kind of difficult.

457
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,740
Sorry.

458
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,750
You don't ever have
to apologize to me, Dexter.

459
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,080
Not for who you are or anything you do.

460
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,380
Looks just like it used to, doesn't it?

461
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,390
Who does it belong to?

462
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,300
Me.

463
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
I got it for you, actually.

464
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,610
I'm really more an apartment person.

465
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,950
You're trapped in a lie, little brother,

466
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,120
the same lie they tried forcing me into.

467
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,490
They?

468
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,160
You know...

469
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,620
Doctors, therapists, group leaders.

470
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,580
What a family they were.

471
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,630
You were never put up for adoption.

472
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,170
Afraid not.

473
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,630
You were three, a little bird with a broken wing.

474
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,470
First cop on the scene, Harry Morgan.

475
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,060
He wanted to make you all better.

476
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,400
But me... I could see it in his eyes.

477
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,650
All he saw was a fucked-up kid.

478
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,860
They all did.

479
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,030
So they locked me up.

480
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,030
I didn't even know you existed.

481
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,660
Of course you didn't.

482
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,210
Harry wanted to keep you all to himself.

483
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,830
And while you were being raised
by the Morgan family,

484
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,800
I only had the memory of a family.

485
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,300
Me.

486
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,260
Mom always told me to look after you.

487
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,020
Imagine how I felt when I tracked you down

488
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,520
and found out you were exactly like me.

489
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,020
I don't have to imagine.

490
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,200
I know what you've been going
through all these years.

491
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,620
The isolation, the otherness,

492
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,630
a hunger that's never satisfied.

493
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,380
Well, you're not alone anymore, Dexter.

494
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,970
You can be yourself with me.

495
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,260
Your real, genuine self.

496
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,190
Takes the breath away, doesn't it?

497
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,800
I think we're ready for Debra.

498
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,080
I've prepared her just the way you like.

499
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,790
This time, we'll do it together.

500
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,790
Does it have to be Deb?

501
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,630
It's the only way.

502
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,420
But she's my...

503
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,470
Fake sister. I know.

504
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,680
Tell me something...

505
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,770
Your victims, are they all killers?

506
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,860
Yes.

507
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,650
Harry teach you that?

508
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,280
He taught me a code...

509
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,990
to survive.

510
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,450
Like an absurd avenger?

511
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,160
That's not why I kill.

512
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,330
You can be yourself around me.

513
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,800
Who am I?

514
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,220
A killer...

515
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,850
without reason or regret.

516
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,060
You're free.

517
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,690
You can be that way, too.

518
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,860
What about the code?

519
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,530
You don't have a code.

520
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,530
Harry did.

521
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,870
And he's been dead ten years.

522
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,210
You can't keep him sitting
on your shoulder like Jiminy fucking Cricket.

523
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,750
You need to embrace who you are now.

524
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,430
I don't know who I am.

525
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,220
Of course you don't.

526
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,900
You've been away from
your family since you were three,

527
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,770
but I'm here now. I can help you.

528
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,070
We can take this journey together.

529
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,490
I can't.

530
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,540
Not Deb.

531
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,210
Don't say that.

532
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,880
I'm very...

533
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,710
fond of her.

534
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,590
You can't be a killer and a hero.

535
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,760
It doesn't work that way!

536
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,440
Cover the yard! We're going into the house!

537
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,700
Fuck.

538
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,450
In the garage!

539
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,160
Through that door!

540
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,080
It's locked. Fuck! Cover this door!

541
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,540
Cover the door!

542
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,040
Come on. Stay with me.

543
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,550
Shit.

544
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,380
Maria, stay on the door.

545
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,430
He's trapped inside. I'm breaking in.

546
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,090
Cover me, man.

547
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,520
Get in.

548
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,150
Shit.

549
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,620
Chopper 1 to command,

550
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,880
we're broadening the search
to a five-mile radius.

551
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,340
Any headache, dizziness?

552
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,050
I'm fine. I just want to go home.

553
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,510
I'm afraid we have to take you
you to the hospital.

554
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,760
Standard procedure.

555
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,060
You're saying Rudy called you?

556
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,020
Why would he do that?

557
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,730
Maybe he wanted me to try to talk him down.

558
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,150
He was having second
thoughts about killing Deb.

559
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,150
He seemed to feel like we have
some kind of connection.

560
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,520
He's not the only one.

561
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,990
He said he'd kill Deb
if I didn't show up alone.

562
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:30,030
Well, you almost fucking got her killed.

563
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,950
I'm gonna request an immediate
suspension when we get back.

564
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,080
You're gonna what?

565
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,410
Morgan, you shouldn't be out here.

566
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,410
Are you questioning Dexter?

567
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,790
Back the fuck off my brother!

568
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,130
He just saved my life! He's a fucking hero!

569
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,130
Want each of you to treat him
that way, God damn it!

570
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,770
Way to go, Deb.

571
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,320
I thought you were gonna burst
a frontal lobe out there.

572
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,280
Assholes.

573
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,630
Stop. You're gonna dislocate it.

574
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,670
Get it off me. I'm gonna be sick.

575
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,960
Relax.

576
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,920
Here.

577
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,140
He's still out there.

578
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,980
Yeah.

579
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,980
And he didn't get what he wanted.

580
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,190
No.

581
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,320
Think he'll try it again?

582
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,950
Maybe.

583
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,290
I'll talk to Captain Matthews

584
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,040
about getting us an officer stationed
outside your hospital room.

585
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,290
No, I'm not staying in a fucking hospital.

586
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,710
There's nothing fucking wrong with me.

587
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,340
Well, you're not staying at home.

588
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,130
Well, I'll just crash with you.

589
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,390
Let's just wait and see what
the doctor says, all right?

590
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,760
Yeah.

591
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,690
Why me, Dex?

592
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,990
Why'd he choose me?

593
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,490
You're just lucky, I guess.

594
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,760
I was so scared. I was so scared.

595
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,140
- I know.
- Thank you.

596
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,480
Thank you. Thank you.

597
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,480
Dad would be so proud.

598
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,030
It's me.

599
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,790
Paul, this is harassment.

600
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,120
Just tell me if he's acting weird.

601
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,170
Who?

602
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:31,000
Dexter. He hasn't been
himself lately, has he?

603
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,670
How could he be, after what he did to me?

604
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,090
That's it. I'm done.

605
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,420
Call again and you can forget
about ever seeing the kids.

606
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,550
I am not gonna subject them to your insanity.

607
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,640
Fine, if that's what it takes
for you to listen to me.

608
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,810
- I want to know that they're safe.
- Why are you doing this?

609
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,140
You want me to be
miserable and alone like you?

610
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:52,440
All I want is for you to look for a shoe.

611
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,770
A shoe?

612
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,860
Could be in the kitchen or in the backyard.
It's missing.

613
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,660
I checked, and it wasn't in
the items that they got when I was arrested.

614
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,200
Why would it be here?

615
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,620
I was trying to figure out
why my ankle was so bruised.

616
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,870
Now I'm thinking it got banged
when he dragged me out,

617
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,750
when my shoe was knocked off.

618
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,710
Good night, Paul.

619
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,260
Night.

620
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,310
Screw you.

621
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,850
What did I just do?

622
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,310
I drove away a brother
who accepts me, sees me,

623
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,610
for an adopted sister
who'd reject me if she knew

624
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,820
and a foster father who betrayed me.

625
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:43,320
That's what it was, a betrayal.

626
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,160
The most important single fact about me.

627
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm not alone. And Harry kept it from me.

628
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,580
What do I really owe him after that?

629
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,750
Mr. Morgan?

630
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,720
- Mr. Morgan?
- That's me.

631
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,060
Your sister has some bruises,
but no major injuries.

632
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,020
Still, you should keep an eye on her.

633
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,310
I'll write a prescription for a mild sedative.

634
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,640
But she's OK, right?

635
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,600
She can go home with you tonight,

636
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,770
or we can keep her here at the hospital.

637
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,400
It's your choice.

638
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,530
Don't worry. The sheets are clean.

639
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,040
We aim to please here at Chez Dex.

640
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,000
I'll be sleeping on the couch
with a spring in my side

641
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,050
just to make sure
you're safe tonight, but...

642
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:44,720
we're gonna have to talk
tomorrow about a long-term plan,

643
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,890
after you get a good night's sleep.

644
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,860
Good night, sister.

645
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,460
I stopped by your prosthetics lab

646
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,620
after I left Deb at the hospital.

647
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,710
Your work's so good, you even fooled yourself.

648
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,300
Sweet dreams, Bynie.

649
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,500
Hey.

650
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,090
You weren't supposed to wake up.

651
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,750
I guess not.

652
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,840
Sorry.

653
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,840
Police recorded all your knives as evidence.

654
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,600
Took a while to find your dinner flatware.

655
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,600
Sterling.

656
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,020
I keep it for special occasions.

657
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,270
Which you are.

658
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,610
I can give you more tranquilizer if you want.

659
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,910
It's a service I don't usually offer.

660
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,960
What am I, one of your victims now?

661
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:04,250
You going to collect a sample
of Bynie's blood for your collection?

662
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,630
No, you're not a trophy...

663
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,920
but you need to be put down.

664
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,550
Why? Because of your code?

665
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,400
And the safety of my sister.

666
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,360
She's not your real sister.

667
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,650
She's a stranger to you,
and she'll always be one.

668
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,450
I tried to help you by killing her.

669
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,990
I know that!

670
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,460
You should know this isn't easy for me.

671
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,600
You've done more to deserve
my knife than anyone.

672
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,030
You're the only one
I ever wanted to set free.

673
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:16,780
You're the one that needs
setting free, little brother.

674
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,950
Your life is a lie.

675
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,950
You'll never be what you...

676
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,170
Sorry.

677
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,800
I can't hear any more...

678
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:38,470
'cause you're right.

679
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,060
How did you know he was here?

680
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,810
A neighbor saw the door open.

681
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:27,560
We got his fingerprints on
the knife, a note on the fridge,

682
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,060
and a single incised wound to the neck.

683
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:32,190
Slight upward angle.

684
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:37,240
Even a stigmata of hesitation in the stroke.

685
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,070
Looks like a clear suicide.

686
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,370
He does himself the same way
he did the hookers. Poetic.

687
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,540
Retarded. Look at him. He's dead.

688
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,880
The ice-truck killer always flaunted
his kills as if he was untouchable.

689
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,710
By taking his own life,

690
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,000
he's preventing us from ever catching him.

691
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,880
I don't care why he did it.
I'm just glad he did.

692
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,360
Decaf mochaccino, non-fat, no whip.
Your favorite.

693
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,740
I got your message.

694
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,580
How's Debra?

695
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,950
She has all her limbs.

696
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,910
Thank God she's alive.

697
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,170
That poor thing must be a mess.

698
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,330
Falling for a serial killer.

699
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,880
What are the odds?

700
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,670
- What about you?
- What about me?

701
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,470
Are you all right?

702
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,800
Yeah.

703
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:48,930
No.

704
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,110
I've been through a lot lately.

705
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:07,790
I could use a little more time
with you and the kids.

706
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,330
We could, too.

707
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,960
I'm sorry I've been so...

708
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:32,230
Next time, could you just
let me know what's going on?

709
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,900
When you didn't return my calls,

710
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,030
I started to get a little paranoid.

711
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,070
I can be better about that.

712
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:44,070
Good.

713
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,580
Who knows?

714
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,700
You might even find I can handle the truth.

715
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:57,000
I wish that was the case.

716
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:02,220
The reality is, there's nobody left alive
who can handle my truth.

717
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,560
Doakes always sensed
I was hiding something.

718
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,980
Now he knows.

719
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,860
My devil danced with his demon,
and the fiddler's tune isn't over.

720
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,750
I wonder what it would be like
for everything inside me

721
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,960
that's denied and unknown to be revealed.

722
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,010
But I'll never know.

723
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,350
I live my life in hiding.

724
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,850
My survival depends on it.

725
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,730
Dearly damaged Debra,

726
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,480
she's here to face what's left of the monster,

727
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:04,990
spit on his carcass, mourn him.

728
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,240
She's in hiding now, too.

729
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:12,870
Harry's daughter won't let anyone see
what she's suffering inside.

730
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,080
That's her tragedy.

731
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,500
My tragedy is that I killed
the one person I didn't have to hide from.

732
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,420
And I'm the only one who mourns him.

733
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,310
Everyone would probably thank me

734
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,850
if they knew I was the one
who drained him of his life.

735
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,100
Good job. You sliced him up good.

736
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:44,280
In fact, I'm sure
they'd appreciate a lot of my work.

737
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,700
Way to take out the trash. Thanks, man.

738
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:55,450
All right, Dexter, protecting our children!

739
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:16,220
This is what it must feel like
to walk in full sunlight,

740
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,520
my darkness revealed,

741
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,100
my shadow self embraced.

742
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,410
Yeah, they see me.

743
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:35,160
I'm one of them...

744
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,757
In their darkest dreams
