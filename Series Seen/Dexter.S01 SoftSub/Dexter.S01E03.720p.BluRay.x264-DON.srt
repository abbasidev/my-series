1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,680
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,590
What happened changed
something inside you, Dex.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,680
It got into you too early.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,310
Your urge to kill is only gonna get stronger.

5
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,940
I wanna catch him
before he kills another one of my girls.

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,190
What can I do to help?

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,650
No blood.

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,690
What a beautiful idea.

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,020
Refrigerated truck.

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,780
He wants a cold environment
to slow the flow of blood.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,490
I suppose I should be upset,
even feel violated,

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,790
but I'm not.

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,210
I think this is a friendly message,

14
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:38,040
kind of like, "Hey, wanna play?"

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,050
Finding that truck is your
golden ticket into Homicide.

16
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,170
So Miami's the haystack,
and the ice truck's the needle.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,300
I just found the fucking needle.

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,970
This is seriously fucked-up.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,720
I think he's trying to impress me.

20
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,390
And it's working.

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,310
The captain wants you
reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,110
Thank you, sir.

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,240
Rita is, in her own way,
as damaged as me.

24
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,370
- Are you gonna kiss him?
- Actually, yes.

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,040
We just got an ID on the body
from under the causeway.

26
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,540
His name is Ricky Simmons.
He was a cop.

27
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,420
Ricky Simmons was under deep cover
in Carlos Guerrero's family.

28
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,260
Guerrero's crossing a whole new line.

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,340
Now he's pissed off
the entire Miami Police Department.

30
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,890
It's me. It's James, OK? It's OK.

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,900
Was Kara sleeping with someone
other than Ricky?

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,650
Was it you?

33
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,900
James, she died.

34
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,900
Miami's full of good cops,

35
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,030
a lot of them here today.

36
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,650
But no offense, I wouldn't want
any of you hitting on my sister.

37
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,530
Ricky was different.

38
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,240
He was the kind of guy
you hoped your sister would fall for.

39
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,540
Most people have a hard time
dealing with death,

40
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,210
but I'm not most people.

41
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,330
It's the grief
that makes me uncomfortable.

42
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,630
Not because I'm a killer, really.
I just don't understand all that emotion,

43
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,799
which makes it tough to fake.

44
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:17,049
In those cases, shades come in handy.

45
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:18,179
Mac.

46
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:23,429
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thanks, man.

47
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:24,979
It's a fucking travesty.

48
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,809
You going after Guerrero?

49
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,359
Guerrero ordered these hits.

50
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,399
I'm gonna make something stick
to that Cartel cocksucker.

51
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:34,779
I didn't know
you and Ricky were so tight.

52
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:39,409
It ain't about that. Fuck with a cop,
you lose the privilege to walk the streets.

53
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,699
You're right.

54
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,869
...tragic loss of our fellow officer
but we praise his courage.

55
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:45,749
Ricky knew no fear.

56
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:49,339
Can you believe LaGuerta?
She didn't even know Simmons.

57
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:52,709
She knew he was a cop.
Wait. Did you tell her?

58
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,759
Proud of you for coming, bro.
I know you hate funerals.

59
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:58,969
- How you holding up?
- I'm managing.

60
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:04,889
I'm not. Keeping my face pinched in sorrow for
two hours straight is a real chore.

61
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,149
A whole life reduced to ashes.

62
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:11,229
For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

63
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:15,189
But sometimes,
you get a second chance.

64
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,779
Florida prisons kick free
25,000 inmates a year.

65
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:23,039
They don't do that for me,
but it feels like it.

66
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,329
I search for the ones who think
they've beat the system.

67
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,289
They're not hard to find,
like Jeremy Downs.

68
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,339
Jeremy got off easy.

69
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,089
Four years in a juvenile facility
for manslaughter.

70
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:39,839
To the coroner, the knife strokes
looked random, impulsive,

71
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:42,849
but I saw the work of a young virtuoso.

72
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:46,809
Too many major arteries were severed -
femoral, brachial, carotid.

73
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:51,189
Today Jeremy is just another
piece of trash on the street,

74
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,359
but four years ago,
he was the toast of Miami.

75
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,069
It was a gruesome scene today -
the bloody body of a teenage boy

76
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,109
found stabbed to death
inside this south Miami park.

77
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:02,949
Police haven't released
the name of the victim yet

78
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:08,209
but investigators are holding
a 15-year-old suspect in custody.

79
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:10,749
We're hearing that the suspect
lured the older boy

80
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,919
to the pond to spot alligators,
but once they were alone,

81
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:17,049
the victim was robbed
and repeatedly stabbed.

82
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,339
But I knew what he was
and what he'd do again.

83
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:23,389
All I had to do was circle
my calendar and wait.

84
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,149
Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

85
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:34,109
What do you say, crew?
Anybody parched?

86
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,229
What's parched?

87
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,569
When we put in the new lemon tree,

88
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,159
we'll be able to make our own
fresh-squeezed lemonade.

89
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,079
Can we have a lemonade stand?

90
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,079
I'll apply for a business license
first thing in the morning.

91
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,749
Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

92
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,249
I moved here from Michigan
with dreams of fruit trees in my yard.

93
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,509
But they keep dying.

94
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,009
I can't help it. I kill things.

95
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,089
That must be awful.

96
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,099
Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

97
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:08,389
The key to happy citrus is a fertilizer.
Bone meal works the best.

98
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,599
Hey, Rita.

99
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:15,979
Paul doesn't live here anymore.

100
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,569
No shit. He's in jail, but...

101
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,949
See, he still owes me
for two ounces of blow,

102
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,489
which means you owe me.

103
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,869
Don't get involved.

104
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:28,619
I never know in these situations.

105
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,459
- I don't have money.
- You got a car.

106
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,329
You want my car?

107
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,379
Yeah. The keys in it?

108
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,629
You know my dad?

109
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,669
I sure do, little man.

110
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,139
And you want to know something?

111
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:45,969
You look just like him.

112
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,469
I'm gonna tell him you said hi, OK?

113
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:53,479
Look, if you want,
I could go in the house,

114
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,019
throw your furniture around,
make a real mess,

115
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:00,029
but what kind of message
would that send to the little ones?

116
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,939
Just give me the fucking car.

117
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,069
You go inside and get the keys.
I'll wait with our friend.

118
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,449
Come on, kids, let's go inside.

119
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,159
What?

120
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,419
You think you can take me
with your little red shovel?

121
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:47,489
Everything OK in there?

122
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:49,489
Yeah.

123
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:53,829
You need toilet paper?

124
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,619
No.

125
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,219
The guy had no idea
who he was dealing with.

126
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,339
I'll file a report.
We'll get your car back.

127
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:09,549
No, no reports, Dexter.

128
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,769
Thank you, but Paul's out of my life.

129
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,519
I filed for divorce.

130
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,689
I just want my past to go away.

131
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,439
Well, it went away in your Rav 4.

132
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:25,949
Whatever it takes.

133
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:28,859
I can give you a ride to work
until you get another car.

134
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,029
Or I could take the bus
like millions of other people.

135
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,539
Come on, let's go outside
and enjoy this beautiful day.

136
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,289
Come on, kids.

137
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:39,079
What did they use, an ax?

138
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:44,709
It's blunt force.
See the way the head's caved in?

139
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,759
You guys check out the new hottie McGotass
in Dispatch yet?

140
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,389
She's a butter face.

141
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:53,259
What's a butter face?

142
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:57,139
You know, she's got a hot body,
but her face...

143
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,649
How great would it be
to pull a bronco on her?

144
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,309
Yeah.

145
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,229
Yeah?

146
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,569
You do it doggy-style, right?

147
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,399
And just when she's getting into it,

148
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:11,819
you grab her by the hips
and you yell another woman's name.

149
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:15,289
You're riding her like a bronco
cos she's trying to buck you off.

150
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:19,209
Often in life I feel like I'm missing
some essential piece of the human puzzle.

151
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:20,539
This is one of them.

152
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:22,539
What are you doing?
Oh, the bronco.

153
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,129
See? She knows.

154
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,209
I just got my first official Homicide call.
He's back.

155
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:30,089
- Who? The ice-truck killer?
- That's right.

156
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:32,799
You won't believe
where he left the body.

157
00:10:58,459 --> 00:10:59,869
I knew he'd be back.

158
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:02,669
It feels like Christmas morning.

159
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:05,339
Look at that - a miracle on ice.

160
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:06,749
Stunning.

161
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:15,049
You all right, Dexter?

162
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,139
This is like a dream.

163
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:22,479
Standing on the home ice
of the Miami Blades.

164
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,359
I never pegged you for a hockey fan.

165
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:27,229
Yeah, there's something
about standing in a big, cool hole

166
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,149
I find very relaxing.

167
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,659
So, what do we know?

168
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,739
Same as the others. No blood.

169
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:42,709
So far, I don't see any hesitation cuts,
no bones flayed.

170
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:44,629
I think our boy's got his confidence back.

171
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:48,299
He never lost it.
He was just getting bored.

172
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:51,419
What do you think he's trying to tell us?

173
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,629
That hockey's a violent sport.

174
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,509
What else?

175
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,219
He's escalating the thrill.

176
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,399
Posing his victim
in the middle of a 20,000-seat arena

177
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,229
for all Miami to see,

178
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,109
to show them - to show us -

179
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,069
what he's capable of doing.

180
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,199
What did I miss?

181
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,489
Relax. You didn't miss anything.

182
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:21,249
Yeah, but she is - fingertips.

183
00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:24,669
This body belongs to the frozen fingertips
we found in the truck.

184
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:27,919
Sherry Taylor.
It's another prostitute.

185
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,049
No blood, no need for me.

186
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,968
Come up to the command center.
We may have a suspect.

187
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,218
Is there really a suspect?

188
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:47,728
I'll let you know when I get back from
my first official homicide investigation...

189
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:49,728
I know her.

190
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:53,818
- Sherry?
- Yeah, she called herself Cherry.

191
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,278
We worked the same corner
when I was undercover.

192
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,328
You were, like, friends?

193
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,408
Yes.

194
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,368
Do you want a hug?

195
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:08,208
Fuck off.

196
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,958
A surveillance tape is missing
from the security office.

197
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:14,298
Let me guess -
the one covering the ice.

198
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,508
They said you were good.

199
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,838
I got the press knocking
on the door outside.

200
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:21,848
Somebody who was here last night
saw something.

201
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,978
Rent-a-badge, cleaning crew,
crack whore in the men's room?

202
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,148
- Come on, work with me.
- We can't find the night watchman.

203
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,518
Then he's a suspect.

204
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:34,398
Unless the ice-truck killer abducted him
to gain entry into the arena.

205
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,028
Your brother help you with that logic?

206
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,488
He could have just been
at the wrong place at the wrong time.

207
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,988
We need to get to his apartment
to see what we can find.

208
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:44,948
I was hoping I could hit Kiocho,
talk to my old contacts.

209
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:49,118
I thought you wanted to get out of Vice.
Isn't that why you cried to the captain?

210
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:52,458
Yeah, I mean... I didn't cry.

211
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:58,298
Listen, my girls know this victim, OK?
Their information could help us.

212
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,098
No, I want you to work with Doakes.

213
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:04,518
Maria, she has contacts.

214
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:13,648
- You still got your tube top?
- And my nipple clamps.

215
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:16,738
Don't come back without any information.

216
00:14:34,998 --> 00:14:36,878
Everyone moves to Miami to die,

217
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:40,508
which means we have more junk
than any city in America.

218
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:43,758
A skilled bargain hunter
can find real treasure here,

219
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,098
but that's not my idea of hunting.

220
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:55,068
I prefer a stalk-and-ambush approach.

221
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:58,648
My instincts are impeccable,
but I have to be sure of my prey.

222
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,738
We're all adrenaline rats, you know?
Kill it till it dies.

223
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,198
We all meat hunters,
just out looking for dinner.

224
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,198
What you looking for?

225
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:13,378
- Can I see that one?
- Good eye.

226
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,748
It's a fixed-blade skinning knife.
Stainless steel.

227
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:21,758
Real time-saver for the hunter who likes
to do his own butchering in the field.

228
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,968
See the way that blade curves like that?

229
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:26,218
It's like the talon of an eagle.

230
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:28,348
15 bucks, and she's yours.

231
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:33,148
- I'll take it.
- Hell, yeah. Why would you not?

232
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:35,358
I'll get your change.

233
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:46,118
Easy, kid.

234
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,078
What the fuck are you doing, boy?

235
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,538
I didn't see him.

236
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,288
- You all right, mister?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

237
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,668
Honest mistake. No harm.

238
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,798
You be careful with that thing, huh?

239
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:06,508
Sorry about that, boss. I only sell 'em.

240
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,598
So, what you hunt -
trophies or meat?

241
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:18,358
What do you think today, Dex?
The Winchester?

242
00:16:19,608 --> 00:16:21,148
What about the 9mm?

243
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,738
A handgun?

244
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,318
Not exactly the weapon of choice
for pheasants.

245
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,278
You need a wide spread
to bring them down.

246
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,168
Did you ever shoot anybody, Dad?

247
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,288
Afraid so.

248
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,708
- Any of them die?
- Just one.

249
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,298
How did it feel to kill a guy?

250
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:48,888
Not so great, Dex.

251
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:57,558
When you take a man's life,
you're not just killing him,

252
00:16:57,688 --> 00:17:00,438
you're snuffing out
all the things he'll ever become.

253
00:17:03,738 --> 00:17:06,238
As a cop, I only fire my weapon
to save a life.

254
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,988
That's a code I live by.

255
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,868
Killing must serve a purpose.
Otherwise it's murder.

256
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:18,038
- You understand?
- Yeah.

257
00:17:21,128 --> 00:17:22,498
I changed my mind.

258
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:28,968
I think we'll take the Ruger.

259
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,308
Rifle? I thought that shotguns
were best for pheasants.

260
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,638
We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

261
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,028
- It's a big one.
- Yeah.

262
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,528
This deer will put meat on our table tonight.

263
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:54,328
It's still alive.

264
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:05,128
For now, this is how we'll control
the urges you feel.

265
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:08,588
Channel them.
Why don't you go ahead, son?

266
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:10,468
Really?

267
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:22,938
Put the poor animal out of its misery.

268
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:21,618
I'm very proud of you.
You worked hard for this.

269
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:23,458
Thank you, Bishop.

270
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:32,048
Hi, Rose. Congratulations
on your confirmation.

271
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:34,428
Thank you. Do I know you?

272
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,098
My name's James Doakes.
Miami Metro PD.

273
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,598
I'm investigating the murder
of an undercover cop and his wife.

274
00:19:41,728 --> 00:19:43,348
Oh, that's terrible.

275
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:46,188
Were they members of the church?

276
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,608
No, Rose, they weren't.

277
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:50,738
I don't understand.

278
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:52,988
Have you ever seen this man before?

279
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,568
I don't know.
Why are you asking me?

280
00:19:55,698 --> 00:19:57,868
Get away from my daughter.

281
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,368
It's OK.

282
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,208
At my church?

283
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,998
In front of my family?

284
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:07,538
Ricky and Kara had a family, too.

285
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:13,218
You just opened a dangerous door.

286
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,888
No, man, you did...

287
00:20:15,008 --> 00:20:18,888
When you murdered a cop
and an innocent lady.

288
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,968
What is he talking about, Daddy?

289
00:20:21,098 --> 00:20:24,018
- Come on, honey. Let's go!
- Daddy!

290
00:20:24,768 --> 00:20:27,228
You don't play by the rules.
Why should I?

291
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:41,908
You've got five minutes, Bizach, OK?

292
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,538
Yo, look who's back.

293
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,717
Who'd you fuck -
Dolce or Gabbana?

294
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,927
I let them both pull a train, OK?

295
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,797
Listen, I got a confession to make.

296
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:05,017
I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop.

297
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:07,437
Bridgett, get back. I'm not gonna bust...

298
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,687
You're not a cop. You're a whore.

299
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:12,727
- I'm not a fucking whore.
- What's wrong with being a whore?

300
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,027
We trusted you, Brandy.

301
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,657
My name's Debra, OK?
And I'm not here to bust you.

302
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,567
He hit again, the ice-truck killer.

303
00:21:18,697 --> 00:21:20,157
He got Cherry.

304
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:21,907
Cherry?

305
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:27,077
Shit.

306
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:29,417
This shit's crazy. I'm out.

307
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:34,047
I got a sister who lives in Ohio,
runs a fashion-boutique store.

308
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,507
I'm on the bus tomorrow.

309
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,837
I ain't closing my shop
for no sick, psycho bitch.

310
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,677
Fucking woman-hater.

311
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:43,257
I was on the street before him. Fuck it.

312
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,937
I can get him, you guys.
You just got to give me something.

313
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,647
Did any of you all see Cherry
with anyone the night before last?

314
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,267
Well, I saw her last night,

315
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:54,897
and then she got into a car
and never came back.

316
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,647
I was working all night, so...

317
00:21:56,777 --> 00:21:58,487
- Do you know the driver?
- No.

318
00:21:58,607 --> 00:22:01,777
The car was, like,
one of those old station wagons

319
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:03,867
that have wood panels on the side.

320
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:07,907
This is good. This is good. This is a lead.

321
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:10,957
- I should go get LaGuerta to listen.
- Who's LaGuerta?

322
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:15,207
My lieutenant. She hates me.
I'm close with the Captain. I'll talk to him.

323
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,127
What?

324
00:22:18,257 --> 00:22:20,047
Never piss off your pimp.

325
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:22,507
LaGuerta's not my pimp.

326
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:24,007
Is that right?

327
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:25,717
Bitch tell you what to do?

328
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,637
Is your pussy taking all the risk?

329
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,557
Does she steal everything you earn?

330
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:31,937
Yeah, she definitely does that.

331
00:22:32,057 --> 00:22:33,897
She's your pimp, baby,

332
00:22:34,647 --> 00:22:37,567
And she will mess you up
if you play her.

333
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:39,357
I told you, I'm not a fucking whore.

334
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:41,697
What's wrong with being a fucking whore?

335
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,457
Hey.

336
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:55,627
Bought you a present to celebrate
your first official homicide case.

337
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:57,257
Seriously?

338
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:00,217
It's a cactus.

339
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,797
You only have to water it
three times a year.

340
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,847
You didn't have to go out of your way.

341
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,807
I didn't. I was at the swap meet.

342
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:12,347
So, any news on our frosty friend?

343
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:17,357
One of my contacts saw Cherry getting
in a station wagon the night she died.

344
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:20,447
- Did you check the DMV database?
- As we speak.

345
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:24,617
There are thousands of registered
station-wagon owners in Miami-Dade,

346
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,197
but guess who's not on the list?

347
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,617
The night watchman.

348
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:32,617
I knew LaGuerta had her head up her ass.
She doesn't have shit on the ice-truck killer.

349
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,457
Good.

350
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:36,587
Why good?

351
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:41,087
It's good for you.

352
00:23:41,217 --> 00:23:46,137
You're gonna be the one to apprehend
that heinous murderer, not her.

353
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,637
Heinous.

354
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:51,387
All right. Good night, sister.

355
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:55,267
Don't stay up too late.

356
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:57,267
OK.

357
00:23:57,397 --> 00:23:59,857
Thanks for stopping by.

358
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:14,787
- Hello?
- Hi.

359
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:17,877
Are you...?
Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

360
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:19,497
No, it's fine. Hi.

361
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:23,337
I was just reading a sad story.

362
00:24:23,467 --> 00:24:24,757
Is everything OK?

363
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:27,887
Yes, I'm...
Look, the thing is...

364
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:29,597
You need me to pick up Cody?

365
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:33,177
No. Colleen's gonna take him
to karate with Hudson.

366
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,477
- What about Astor's piano?
- Jen's got that covered.

367
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:37,937
It's Social Services.

368
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:40,977
There's a caseworker coming by
the house this afternoon.

369
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:44,067
I should be home by 4:00,
but with the buses...

370
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:48,447
I'll be there. Don't worry about a thing.

371
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,657
Thank you, Dexter.

372
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:56,327
As you all know, a night watchman
from the hockey arena is missing.

373
00:24:56,457 --> 00:25:00,207
Till now, we presumed he was abducted
or murdered by the ice-truck killer.

374
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:03,757
We searched his apartment
and found a stolen surveillance tape

375
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,257
from the night of the murder.

376
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:08,547
Chief of security at
the hockey arena confirmed it.

377
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:11,057
The man you're looking at
is Tony Tucci,

378
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:12,677
the missing night watchman.

379
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:15,597
And here's the best part -
Tucci has a record.

380
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,847
He pulled a knife at a party in '97.

381
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,437
Ladies and gentlemen,

382
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:23,317
I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck killer.

383
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:24,687
Bullshit.

384
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:27,357
Captain Matthews is coordinating
with the FDLE

385
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:29,987
to launch a manhunt
as soon as we get clearances.

386
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:33,197
- Does he drive a station wagon?
- Excuse me?

387
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:35,037
What kind of car does he drive?

388
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:37,787
The last known victim was seen
getting in a station wagon.

389
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,827
I don't recall asking for any questions.

390
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:43,707
Now, from this moment on,
all our resources go to finding this man.

391
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:47,757
Your individual assignments
will be coming shortly. That's all for now.

392
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,307
Doesn't make sense.

393
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:59,687
After being so careful for so long,
why would he leave evidence?

394
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:01,517
Of course I agree with my sister,

395
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,647
but unlike her, I'm not upset.

396
00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:07,067
He's still out there, and I'm waiting...

397
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,737
breathless.

398
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,577
- You sure we can't get you anything?
- I'm fine.

399
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:17,247
Rita's usually home in time for the kids.
I'm just backup. Her bus must be late.

400
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,417
My files say Ms. Bennett
has personal transportation.

401
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,457
She did and will again very soon,
probably next week.

402
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:26,707
I just have to make a note of it.

403
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,297
She's doing an exemplary job.

404
00:26:31,347 --> 00:26:33,637
I wish all my home visits were this lovely.

405
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:36,347
So why do you keep coming around, then?

406
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:39,437
Routine follow-up for
all domestic-violence cases

407
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,897
to ensure a stable home environment exists.

408
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,977
It's a good thing.
The system does work from time to time.

409
00:26:45,107 --> 00:26:48,607
I was actually taken in
by a wonderful family.

410
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,487
No abuse.

411
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:54,577
In fact, my foster father understood
I had special needs.

412
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,577
Without him...

413
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:58,407
You're lucky.

414
00:26:59,497 --> 00:27:00,667
Lucky.

415
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:01,957
I'm here!

416
00:27:02,077 --> 00:27:04,287
Hey, everyone, I'm here.

417
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:05,747
Thank you.

418
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,757
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

419
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,587
I am lucky.

420
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:12,677
What do I know about abuse?

421
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:14,717
Without the code of Harry,

422
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:18,467
I'm sure I would have committed
a senseless murder in my youth

423
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:20,637
just to watch the blood flow.

424
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:24,437
Just try and keep him comfortable.
It's about all we can do for him now.

425
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:28,187
I don't understand. A week ago,
the doctor said he was getting better.

426
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:30,237
He is getting better, sweetie.

427
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,527
A body cannot suffer in sweet repose.

428
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:37,537
What does that mean?

429
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,787
What the hell does that mean?

430
00:27:39,907 --> 00:27:42,577
She's weird.

431
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:46,837
Listen, you two,
I'm not gonna be around much longer.

432
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,837
Dad, don't say that.

433
00:27:48,957 --> 00:27:51,127
You can make it through this if you fight.

434
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:56,347
When I'm gone,

435
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,137
I won't be able to stop you
from being who you are.

436
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:02,887
Sooner or later,

437
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:06,147
you'll need to do it.

438
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,147
Do what?

439
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:13,777
Just remember our lessons.

440
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:17,027
What lessons?
What are you talking about?

441
00:28:17,157 --> 00:28:21,697
- I can't make it without you.
- Yes, you can.

442
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:28,377
If you feel like you're slipping,
lean on your sister.

443
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,167
She'll keep you connected.

444
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:35,717
Fucking Forensics report.

445
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:39,057
- What did they find?
- Tucci's hair and fiber.

446
00:28:39,177 --> 00:28:41,387
Of course Tucci's hair
and fibers are on the body.

447
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:44,267
He's hauling her around
with his pork hands.

448
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,477
Any word from the chem lab?

449
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:48,397
Same as the other murders.

450
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:51,477
The killer used liquid nitrogen
to preserve the tissue,

451
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,567
give it that bleached look.

452
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:57,527
You know how unstable liquid nitrogen is?

453
00:28:58,407 --> 00:29:01,487
You'd have to be a lab rat
just to mess around with that shit.

454
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:05,207
Tucci didn't even pass
high-school chemistry.

455
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,167
Watch carefully.
Right there. See?

456
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,706
Right before he repositioned the torso.

457
00:29:10,836 --> 00:29:13,586
- He turned his head.
- Like someone's giving him directions.

458
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:17,426
Someone like the ice-truck killer
holding a motherfucking gun to his back.

459
00:29:18,136 --> 00:29:20,716
- The killer's framing Tucci.
- It looks that way.

460
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:23,926
LaGuerta's gonna lose her
sheep shit when she finds out.

461
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:25,726
She'll have to cancel her press conference.

462
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:29,856
And you know how LaGuerta
loves her press conferences.

463
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,816
Can I borrow this tape?

464
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:13,646
Bingo.

465
00:30:13,776 --> 00:30:17,316
I know what happens next
in this gruesome little scenario.

466
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:19,986
Jeremy is trying to recreate his first kill,

467
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:22,236
ritualize it.

468
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,286
You ready?

469
00:30:26,956 --> 00:30:28,826
I don't know if I want to do this, man.

470
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:31,246
I thought you wanted to see an alligator.

471
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:34,416
- I do.
- Come on. It's in the marsh up here.

472
00:30:34,546 --> 00:30:36,956
Wait. Are you a pussy?

473
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,626
No.

474
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:40,966
OK.

475
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:49,186
Let's go.

476
00:30:50,226 --> 00:30:52,606
It's right up here.

477
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,356
Come on, Jer.

478
00:30:54,476 --> 00:30:56,526
What are you talking about?

479
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,856
Don't be a bitch.

480
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,946
Here we are.

481
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:05,656
I don't see it.

482
00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:07,286
It's right there.

483
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,456
See its eyes sticking out?

484
00:31:14,796 --> 00:31:16,456
You have to get closer.

485
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:21,176
I still don't see it.

486
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:23,886
Really?

487
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:28,636
Maybe I was wrong.

488
00:31:32,346 --> 00:31:34,356
There's no gator here, is there?

489
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,186
I don't know, Lucas.

490
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:41,856
Is there?

491
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:46,406
Anyone see a Frisbee? It flew in here.

492
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:47,576
Oh, shit.

493
00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:49,366
Let's get the fuck out of here.

494
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:05,716
What am I doing out here?

495
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:13,516
Fuck! Fuck!

496
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:17,766
Fuck!

497
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:32,076
All I had to do was drive home,
have a taco, plan my attack.

498
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,956
Instead, I tried to act human,

499
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:36,246
like it's my job to save lives.

500
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:54,766
The code of Harry never covered this.

501
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:57,976
At least I know what Jeremy is

502
00:32:58,106 --> 00:32:59,686
and what I need to do.

503
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:04,696
Don't let her.

504
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:11,696
OK, my brave little soldier.
Let's get this nasty shot out of the way.

505
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:13,826
No! Wait!

506
00:33:13,956 --> 00:33:17,416
- What is it, honey?
- He doesn't want the shot.

507
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:21,126
Your father's very sick.
He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

508
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:23,456
- No, I want pain.
- He wants pain.

509
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,016
I'll have to tell the doctor.

510
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:37,436
He's not going to be happy
you're refusing your medication.

511
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,356
You can tell.

512
00:33:46,486 --> 00:33:48,066
About the nurse? Yeah.

513
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:49,866
She's...

514
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:52,866
like me.

515
00:33:54,536 --> 00:33:57,206
How could you tell?

516
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:01,996
She gives too much morphine.

517
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,376
It's something else.

518
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,796
It's making me worse.

519
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:08,626
She's drugging you.

520
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,846
She's killing you by overdose.

521
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,886
Not just me. Others, too.

522
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:27,946
Stop her.

523
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:31,696
What do you mean, stop her?

524
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:33,826
It's time.

525
00:34:36,036 --> 00:34:38,746
Before she hurts anyone else.

526
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:45,626
See the look on his face,
like he's scared?

527
00:34:45,756 --> 00:34:48,216
Like he has a gun pointed at him?

528
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:52,926
I don't know, Debra.
It's not much - a look off-camera.

529
00:34:53,046 --> 00:34:56,386
There's more. One of my Vice contacts,
Gabrielle - I trust her -

530
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:59,886
she saw the victim get in a wood-paneled
wagon the night of her death.

531
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:02,306
That was the last time anyone saw her.

532
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,356
Did a background report on Tucci.

533
00:35:04,476 --> 00:35:06,526
He doesn't even own a car.

534
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:10,696
There's no fucking way this guy
can be the ice-truck killer. Sir.

535
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:14,156
What does Lieutenant LaGuerta
say about all this?

536
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:18,786
- I came straight to you, Captain.
- You went around her back?

537
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:23,706
- LaGuerta doesn't listen to me.
- You don't violate the chain of command.

538
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:25,456
You just don't.

539
00:35:26,246 --> 00:35:28,796
Now, listen, Debra,
I gave you a shot in Homicide

540
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:31,376
because I think you can make
a decent detective.

541
00:35:32,136 --> 00:35:36,676
But if I find you can't swim in these waters,
I'll put you right back on the street.

542
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:39,176
- You got it?
- Yes, sir.

543
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:44,016
Your father never would have pulled
the kind of shit you just did.

544
00:35:48,436 --> 00:35:51,146
Did you know that one
of your officers has information

545
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:53,986
that casts some doubt
on this manhunt of yours?

546
00:35:54,776 --> 00:35:56,406
Who, Morgan?

547
00:35:57,366 --> 00:36:01,366
I realize you're something of
a folk hero around here, Maria,

548
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:04,496
but it would be a mistake
to ignore the work of a promising officer

549
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:06,666
just to further your political career.

550
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:08,046
Is that what you think I'm doing?

551
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,626
You were a middle-of-the-pack detective
before the press got ahold of you.

552
00:36:11,756 --> 00:36:15,546
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- It's a reality check, and you need it.

553
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,846
And I got it.

554
00:36:19,806 --> 00:36:23,556
Let's cut to the chase.
Are you telling me to call off my manhunt?

555
00:36:23,686 --> 00:36:26,646
I will remind you that Jeb Bush himself
signed off on it.

556
00:36:27,266 --> 00:36:30,856
No, no. You go ahead
and hold your press conference, Maria.

557
00:36:30,986 --> 00:36:34,696
People of this city need to know
we're doing something about this mess.

558
00:36:34,816 --> 00:36:36,696
But don't expect me to bail you out

559
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:39,486
if that night watchman
turns out to be a dead end.

560
00:36:41,036 --> 00:36:43,956
A state-wide manhunt is under way
right now in Florida.

561
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,706
According to police,
a night watchman is on the run

562
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:48,626
after the dismembered body parts

563
00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:51,206
of a young South Beach woman
were found Tuesday,

564
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:53,716
stacked on the home ice
of the Miami Blades.

565
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,216
The woman is believed
to be the latest victim

566
00:36:56,336 --> 00:36:58,216
of the notorious ice-truck killer,

567
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:02,886
now responsible for five deaths
in the Greater Miami area.

568
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:07,146
These terrible attacks have to stop.
And we have to stop them.

569
00:37:08,106 --> 00:37:10,266
With Tony Tucci
now linked to the murders,

570
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,316
it's our mission to find him.

571
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:15,146
Fucking joke.

572
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:19,066
Hey, going out tonight with the guys,
blow off a little steam. You in?

573
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:22,236
- Hey, man, sounds good.
- I'll pick you up at 8:00.

574
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:34,005
Elevator's around the corner and to your left.
Enjoy your stay with us.

575
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:46,015
Hello?

576
00:37:46,135 --> 00:37:48,095
Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

577
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,725
Are you coming to pick up Astor?

578
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:53,605
Oh, no, a friend of mine is - Denise.

579
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:54,855
Is she not there?

580
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:57,355
I'm afraid not, but your daughter is.

581
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,075
She's the last kid left here at school.

582
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,235
I don't have a car. Is she OK?

583
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:08,825
Yeah, she's just fine,
but we can't keep her here much longer.

584
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,285
OK.

585
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,495
OK, I'll work something out.

586
00:38:24,765 --> 00:38:25,805
Do it again!

587
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,765
Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

588
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:30,645
Now, let's see about that splinter.

589
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:35,985
That's a deep one.

590
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,025
This might sting a bit.

591
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:42,445
But the magical splinter fairy
will soon make you forget all about it.

592
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:46,785
- Who's the magical splinter fairy?
- Second cousin to the tooth fairy.

593
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:50,995
She brings candy if you put your splinter
under your pillow at night.

594
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,125
The tooth fairy is make-believe,
just like the bogeyman.

595
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,005
Hi, guys.

596
00:38:57,755 --> 00:38:59,425
Ooh, you're right, Astor.

597
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,335
There's no such thing
as the bogeyman.

598
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,045
But the splinter fairy,
she's the real deal.

599
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:08,015
Will the splinter fairy come if I cry?

600
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:13,645
Thanks for picking her up.

601
00:39:14,645 --> 00:39:17,275
If I had a heart,
it might be breaking right now.

602
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,755
Oh, sorry.

603
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:52,785
Who we picking up now, man?
He sure ain't sitting on my lap.

604
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:54,915
We're not picking up anybody, bro.

605
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:58,205
What we doing in the Gables?

606
00:40:58,745 --> 00:41:02,005
I told you.
We're blowing off some steam.

607
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,585
This is it.

608
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:06,085
What the hell is this?

609
00:41:06,215 --> 00:41:07,795
It's a disguise.

610
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:13,305
One of Guerrero's top lieutenants lives here
and we're gonna fuck him up.

611
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:17,765
Hold up, Mac. I thought you said
you wanted to go out and get shit-faced.

612
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,765
I am shit-faced.

613
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:22,725
How do I look?

614
00:41:25,855 --> 00:41:28,985
Man, I'm all for sending the message,
but this ain't the way.

615
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,865
Why the hell not?

616
00:41:30,985 --> 00:41:32,995
The guy's scum.

617
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,205
Mac, listen. I've got to talk to you.

618
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,045
Mac, Mac!

619
00:41:44,165 --> 00:41:45,915
Hey, listen up, man.

620
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:50,095
I showed my face to Guerrero.
They gonna think I'm behind this shit.

621
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:52,675
- That's part of the plan.
- What plan?

622
00:41:52,805 --> 00:41:55,345
You fucked my sister.
You fucked a cop's wife.

623
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:57,765
Now you're just fucked, buddy.

624
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,195
Open the door!

625
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:12,775
Shit.

626
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,615
Motherfucker!

627
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,915
Fuck.

628
00:42:44,975 --> 00:42:46,895
Quit fucking around. Turn on the lights.

629
00:42:48,655 --> 00:42:51,565
Come on, man,
turn on the fucking lights!

630
00:42:56,655 --> 00:42:57,825
You're mine now.

631
00:42:57,955 --> 00:42:59,495
- What do you want?
- Silence.

632
00:42:59,615 --> 00:43:02,455
You gonna fuck me, faggot?
I killed the last guy who raped me.

633
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,585
What guy?

634
00:43:11,215 --> 00:43:12,925
He raped you?

635
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:16,175
The guy you killed when you were 15?

636
00:43:17,225 --> 00:43:18,975
Why didn't you tell anybody?

637
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:21,475
Would you?

638
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:27,275
He fucked me, and I killed him,
and if you try, I'll kill you, too.

639
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:33,115
I understand now.
Why didn't I see it before?

640
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,115
Jeremy didn't murder that boy
four years ago.

641
00:43:36,235 --> 00:43:38,825
He was taking out the garbage.

642
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:40,745
Just like I do.

643
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:48,625
I don't want to cancel all my credit cards,
and I hate waiting in line at the DMV,

644
00:43:48,755 --> 00:43:51,125
so give me back the wallet
you stole from my car,

645
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:53,255
or I'll break your fucking neck.

646
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,255
It's in my backpack.

647
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:16,985
Wait, is that all?

648
00:44:20,195 --> 00:44:21,535
You want more?

649
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,545
That boy who raped you four years ago,
did he deserve to die?

650
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:34,755
Yeah, he did.

651
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:37,595
Well, the boy the other day didn't.

652
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:42,805
Remember that.
It could save your life one day.

653
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:51,185
Mr. Tinker?

654
00:44:55,315 --> 00:44:56,655
Mr. Tinker?

655
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,905
Mr. Tinker, where are you?

656
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:05,325
Mr. Tinker?

657
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:12,205
Are you trapped behind the couch again,
Mr. Tinker-stinker?

658
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,965
The nurse was my first playmate.

659
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:16,675
I'll always be grateful to her

660
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:20,345
for opening up so many
magnificent new doors for me.

661
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,115
Things were a little messy in the beginning.

662
00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:44,495
Hey, perfecting a new craft takes time.

663
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:46,955
But I was trained well.

664
00:45:47,075 --> 00:45:50,284
Those who witnessed my early stumbles
never had a chance to tell.

665
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:12,314
I've just been looking
through your photo album.

666
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:14,354
I hope you don't mind.

667
00:46:17,944 --> 00:46:19,904
Are all your victims in here?

668
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:42,094
I'm sorry. Let me help you with that.

669
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:50,684
Scream and lose a tongue.

670
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:08,574
I helped them...

671
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:12,324
all of them.

672
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,164
I took their pain away.

673
00:47:17,714 --> 00:47:19,464
I understand.

674
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:24,294
Now it's time to take away your pain.

675
00:47:38,644 --> 00:47:40,814
It was messier than I anticipated,

676
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,564
but it was still a special day.

677
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:53,414
But, of course, it was really Harry
who paved the road to my salvation.

678
00:47:55,954 --> 00:47:58,414
With the nurse put down,
Harry lived another year

679
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:02,214
before hardening arteries
squeezed the last bit of life from him,

680
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:06,174
but his lessons have never failed me.

681
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:14,184
Harry taught me that death isn't the end.

682
00:48:14,304 --> 00:48:18,354
It's the beginning of a chain reaction
that will catch you if you're not careful.

683
00:48:28,944 --> 00:48:32,704
He taught me that none of us
are who we appear to be on the outside...

684
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:39,244
...but we must maintain
appearances to survive.

685
00:48:49,014 --> 00:48:51,304
But there was something
Harry didn't teach me,

686
00:48:51,424 --> 00:48:55,264
something he didn't know,
couldn't possibly know.

687
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:59,564
The wilfull taking of life represents
the ultimate disconnect from humanity.

688
00:48:59,684 --> 00:49:02,934
It leaves you an outsider,
forever looking in,

689
00:49:03,064 --> 00:49:05,064
searching for company to keep.

690
00:49:17,164 --> 00:49:20,294
- Sweet ride!
- Is it yours?

691
00:49:20,414 --> 00:49:23,294
It's yours, until your mom
can get a new one.

692
00:49:23,414 --> 00:49:25,924
I borrowed it from an impound
right before auction.

693
00:49:26,044 --> 00:49:28,174
- Dexter...
- Can we get in?

694
00:49:28,294 --> 00:49:29,504
You better.

695
00:49:34,844 --> 00:49:37,014
All you can do is play along at life

696
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:39,684
and hope that sometimes you get it right.

697
00:49:45,484 --> 00:49:47,404
Thank you.

698
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,701
Score one for the little wooden boy.
