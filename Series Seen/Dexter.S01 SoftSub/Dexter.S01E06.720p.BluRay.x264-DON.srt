1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,580
No blood. What a beautiful idea.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,580
Brother, I just found the fucking ice truck.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,000
It is my new friend.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,720
When he broke into my apartment,
he took some time to get to know me -

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:26,430
my life, my secrets.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,430
Paul doesn't live here anymore.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,060
No shit.
He's in jail.

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,600
But, see, he still owes me
for two ounces of blow,

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,110
which means you owe me.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,440
The coyote wanted more money,
I didn't have it.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,450
Poor bastards - spend their life savings,
get stuffed into a fishhold.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,320
- If they can't pay...
- They disappear.

14
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,950
Jorge Castillo -

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,450
the only suspect even
remotely close to the park

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,870
where Yelina was supposed
to drop the money.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,080
Excuse me.
Private yard.

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,630
Sorry, I just assumed you were Cuban.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,260
American, pal, just like you.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,510
Just like me.

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,970
Coño.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,810
Get back in there, you Cuban piece of shit.

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,440
They're even better-matched than I thought.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,770
Fucking animals.

25
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,690
God bless America.

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,280
No.

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,450
Taking the extra time to kill Valerie
may have been ill-advised.

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,660
My life has always been a sequence
of carefully planned moments.

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,250
But sometimes
you just have to take a risk.

30
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,580
Life is so fleeting, so fragile,

31
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,710
every breath the potential to be our last.

32
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,180
You ready?

33
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,980
Can I have my cereal now?

34
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,980
We all grieve in our own way.

35
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,110
Sure.

36
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,320
I prefer the six-year-old approach.

37
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,490
Yet another I've sent to a watery grave.

38
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,280
Well, not quite.

39
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,500
Hey, what about this one?

40
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,290
I want angel cake.

41
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,340
It's angel food, stupid,
and you don't get a vote.

42
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,510
It's my birthday.

43
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,630
Guys.

44
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,560
So, how'd it go?

45
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,060
Bob the goldfish, may he rest in peace.

46
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,190
Thanks for coming over
and taking care of this for me.

47
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,230
- Dead stuff.
- I know.

48
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,730
Well, go have a seat.

49
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,530
Your treat for coming over early
is on its way.

50
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,830
I don't get birthdays - the party, the song.

51
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,580
Celebrating another year
just being alive feels forced.

52
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,460
That one.
That's the one I want.

53
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,760
- Coconut it is.
- I hate coconut.

54
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,839
You've never had coconut.

55
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,929
It's dispatch.
I might have to settle for toast to go.

56
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:28,109
Sure, what's the location?

57
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,899
I'll be right there.

58
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:45,499
The crime scene.

59
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:48,079
My crime scene.

60
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:13,319
I shouldn't have killed them both.
I didn't have enough time.

61
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,609
A footprint, a microscopic drop of blood.

62
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:19,909
What did I leave behind?

63
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,429
Impossible.

64
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,179
Nice place setting, huh?
We're running her prints now.

65
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:48,229
It had to be him.
He's watching me.

66
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:52,979
Good.

67
00:06:53,109 --> 00:06:54,979
ID the victim.

68
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:04,119
- You find anything else?
- That ain't enough?

69
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,449
Any eyewitnesses?

70
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,499
Just do your job.
Worry about the blood.

71
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,039
You gonna answer that?

72
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,419
This tin can smells like ass.

73
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:21,759
The sooner you get busy,
the sooner we can finger who did this.

74
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,139
You heard the man.

75
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,109
He dove 100 feet to bring up the body.

76
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,739
He's getting back at me
for not killing that security guard.

77
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:50,039
Please tell me this wasn't the ice-truck killer.
I've got the press sniffing outside.

78
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:51,079
No, it's not his M.O.

79
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:55,249
We got an ID. Valerie Castillo.
Her husband, Jorge, owns the salvage yard.

80
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,299
Well, then, try and track him down.

81
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,339
Sir, we found something.

82
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,219
You got anything?

83
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:11,099
No bruising.
Nothing under her nails.

84
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,729
She didn't put up a fight.

85
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:17,939
If she was killed here, which I doubt, whoever
did it was a real pro.

86
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:21,279
Under normal circumstances,
I'd take that as a compliment.

87
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,029
- Prints?
- She's clean.

88
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:27,199
This trailer - that's another matter.

89
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:31,159
I don't even want to know
what some of those stains are.

90
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,169
Yo, Dex, I think I found something.
Zoom in on this, will you?

91
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,959
I'm kind of low on batteries here.

92
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,379
Dude, it'll take, like, two seconds.

93
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,099
Yo, what's up with you today?
You're throwing off my chi.

94
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:47,759
You're not Chinese.

95
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:48,759
I'm not?

96
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,679
Look, right here.

97
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:55,479
Does that look like a needle mark to you?

98
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,529
It's more like a bug bite, blemish maybe.

99
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:06,239
Yeah, I guess.

100
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:11,119
I'm gonna let the coroner bag her.

101
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:12,959
I'm hungry.

102
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,719
This ain't no auto garage.

103
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,139
Oh, God.
Oh, I didn't need to see that.

104
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,639
You never seen
a latrine before, Morgan?

105
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:37,309
Yeah, just not indoors.

106
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:41,529
- Well, the army taught me a lot of things.
- I feel a Desert Storm story coming on.

107
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,399
Digging holes for people to take a dump?
That was most important.

108
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:46,819
I'm not really getting that.

109
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:49,579
It doesn't matter how many bars
you got on your collar.

110
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:52,789
Everybody's shit stinks.
We were partners a long time.

111
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:56,579
From the looks of things, Valerie Castillo's
better half was knee-deep.

112
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,339
- You like the husband for this?
- It's always the husband.

113
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,719
What have you got?

114
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,759
It looks like a phone number
and a name - Mariel.

115
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:10,099
Call it in to Batista.
He can run it down for us.

116
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,889
Sergeant Doakes.

117
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,809
We heard movement in the trunk.

118
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,809
I got it. I got it.

119
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:29,029
You all right, kid? Come on, man.

120
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,119
- No.
- Subtle. Maybe you should cuff him.

121
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,189
The noose is tightening.

122
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,689
This is how it ends -
in the hands of a seven-year-old?

123
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:09,149
Hey, Deb.

124
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,029
I usually like kids.

125
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,529
Who's the boy?

126
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:16,159
All we got so far is that he's Cuban
and he seems to like LaGuerta.

127
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,869
Spend enough time in a trunk,
she'd look good to anybody.

128
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,999
Did he, you know, see anything?

129
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,719
I'm not sure. He's pretty out of it.
Social services is on the way.

130
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:32,889
You OK? You got a whole
brow thing going on.

131
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:35,219
Morgan, bring some water!

132
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:37,979
I love her.

133
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:41,599
Maybe I should spend some time
in a hot trunk, too.

134
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:45,399
My neat little world of lies
is crumbling all around me,

135
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:50,069
and I can't tell a soul,
especially not Deb.

136
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:55,199
- Deb, we've been through this.
- But I have my books.

137
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,289
I could just stay in the car
or I can walk with you guys.

138
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:01,999
I promise I'll be quiet.
You won't even know I'm there.

139
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,629
The pheasants will know you're there.

140
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:06,419
- But Dexter was my age when...
- Deb, that's enough.

141
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:09,259
The Logans are waiting.
Did you pack your swimsuit?

142
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,009
- Yes.
- Good girl.

143
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,549
I want to see that backflip
when we come home.

144
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,429
All right. Go on out to the car.
We'll be there in a sec.

145
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,809
She does kind of have a point, Dad.

146
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:27,939
What we do your sister
can never know about.

147
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:33,989
Keeping the truth from the people
closest to you is how you'll survive...

148
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,829
and how you'll protect them
if anything goes wrong.

149
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:48,169
Guys, hurry up.

150
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,799
You're gonna be late for school.

151
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,719
I'm headed to the store.
Is there anything else you want?

152
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,849
- Balloons aren't much of a list.
- It's OK.

153
00:12:56,969 --> 00:13:00,349
I don't need that other stuff.
It's too expensive.

154
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,389
How about you let me worry
about that stuff, OK?

155
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,099
It's your party.
You can have whatever you want.

156
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:15,659
- Hello?
- Hey, babe, it's me.

157
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:18,699
Go wait in the car.

158
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,039
What's wrong with Mom?

159
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,829
She only gets that way
when she's talking to Dad.

160
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:34,169
I was able to track down that name, Mariel,
with the number that you called in.

161
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,639
She's a Cuban refugee.
She's staying with cousins.

162
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,679
- I had a car bring her in.
- Why scratch the number in the floor?

163
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:42,849
Next of kin, in case something
happened to her.

164
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:46,229
Guys like Castillo are ruthless.
They prey on families.

165
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:49,399
He was holding Mariel and
six others captive at a salvage yard.

166
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,769
That explains the garage.

167
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,109
If the relatives don't pay the release fee,
the coyote would dump their ass overboard.

168
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:57,739
Cocksuckers make me sick.
Come on.

169
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:12,839
Mariel, when was the last time
you saw Jorge Castillo?

170
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,429
When he locked her
and the other refugees up

171
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,519
after pulling them from the boat.

172
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:33,439
They went without food and water.

173
00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:36,649
Some guy tried to escape,
but he was beaten by Jorge.

174
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,109
How'd she get free?

175
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,709
Somebody opened the door to the garage.

176
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:05,309
She said, "When we find them,
to make them suffer for what they did,

177
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:07,929
"especially that concha
that treated her like a dog."

178
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:10,479
Ah, got you.

179
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,189
Fuck me.
The wife was in on it.

180
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:15,109
Ask if she knows the little boy
social services picked up.

181
00:15:22,619 --> 00:15:24,619
She never saw a boy.

182
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:32,169
No hair, no fibers,
C.O.D. exsanguination.

183
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:33,459
So far, so good.

184
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,378
- You're hovering.
- Keep reading. Wait for it.

185
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:39,168
This is a prelim. I don't have time...

186
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,088
M-fucking-99.

187
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:44,428
Etorphine hydrochloride?

188
00:15:44,558 --> 00:15:47,848
An animal tranquilizer
more powerful than morphine.

189
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:50,728
It causes total paralysis.

190
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:54,858
That mark on her neck kept bugging me,
so I ordered up a tox screen.

191
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:58,028
That's it.
No more doughnuts for Masuka.

192
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:00,738
Dude, this stuff is strictly controlled.

193
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:04,448
The only way to get it
is with a D.E.A. license.

194
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:07,578
I put a request in for the list.

195
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:11,828
- I should have it for Doakes in the morning.
- Nice.

196
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:14,578
Yeah, baby.

197
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:20,088
I'm on that list, and eventually the alias
I used will lead them back to me.

198
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,008
Tick-tock.

199
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:29,218
Hey, you.

200
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:30,678
Thank God you're there.

201
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:35,228
- I really need to talk with someone.
- Everything OK?

202
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:37,478
Paul called after you left.

203
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:40,528
- Paul? Who's Paul?
- My soon-to-be ex.

204
00:16:40,648 --> 00:16:43,778
He's already out of jail, overcrowding.
Can you believe it?

205
00:16:43,908 --> 00:16:47,578
Every time something goes a little bit right,
something like this happens.

206
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,538
- He wants to come to Astor's party.
- What did you tell him?

207
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:55,578
I'd have to think about it.
But even if I say no, he won't listen.

208
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:56,998
He never does.

209
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:01,088
Can you come over tonight?

210
00:17:01,218 --> 00:17:03,588
I'm kind of under the gun here, big case.

211
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:06,638
I shouldn't be dumping all this on you.
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,428
No, don't be.

213
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,428
Tell you what, I'll stop by if I can.
I promise.

214
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,098
OK. I'll keep a plate warm just in case.

215
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:17,018
Thanks. Bye.

216
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:21,608
Check the marinas.
Find Jorge Castillo's boat.

217
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:23,738
We'll search the house.

218
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:28,738
- Where's LaGuerta?
- Trying to bring that kid in for a sketch.

219
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:31,788
- Sketch?
- He told social services

220
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:34,918
that some guy saved him from the bad lady.

221
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:36,828
Valerie Castillo?

222
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:40,048
Sounds like she got exactly
what she had coming to her.

223
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:42,458
Personally, I'd shake this guy's hand.

224
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:44,378
Yeah, you say that now.

225
00:17:55,768 --> 00:17:58,608
Found his passport.

226
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:02,028
God, I feel like I need a shower
just looking at this douche bag.

227
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,778
Well, keep searching. Phone records,
bank accounts, credit cards.

228
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,568
Maybe the wife got greedy, and he killed her.

229
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,618
Maybe.

230
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,868
This morning,
what was that thing by the car?

231
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,168
What thing?

232
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:22,338
Before you opened the trunk,
you tried to cockblock me.

233
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,338
I was just looking out for my team.

234
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:26,468
I didn't see you looking out for LaGuerta.

235
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:28,508
- I would if she'd asked.
- I didn't ask.

236
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:32,138
Fine.
Next time, just get your ass shot.

237
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:39,018
- It's possible our guy left town.
- If he even did it.

238
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:43,728
- What if we have a copycat killer?
- That's a bit of a stretch.

239
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,988
What if the person
who killed Valerie Castillo

240
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:49,858
tried to bleed her out like
the ice-truck killer but didn't know how?

241
00:18:49,988 --> 00:18:52,578
- She wasn't a hooker.
- She was killed someplace else

242
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,198
and laid out in a ritualistic manner,
just like all the others.

243
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:57,908
- She wasn't in pieces.
- She had cuts on her neck.

244
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:02,788
I'm just saying, with all the media coverage
on the ice-truck killer,

245
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:04,418
it's possible.

246
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:06,418
What do you suggest, Morgan?

247
00:19:06,548 --> 00:19:09,508
Let me work up a profile
in case Jorge doesn't pan out.

248
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:12,508
Fine. Whatever.

249
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:19,308
That's the second time
you've made that face.

250
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,438
Who are you avoiding?

251
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:25,318
We got one more stop to make.

252
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:36,038
Nothing lasts forever.

253
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,498
Just ask a Ford Pinto.

254
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:43,128
Eventually, most serial killers get caught.

255
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:47,048
There's really not much
of a retirement plan.

256
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:52,718
But it can't end like this. It's too soon.
I'm not ready.

257
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,728
He saw me.

258
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:25,998
What's this?

259
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:30,218
You've been asking who's been calling.
My mom lives here.

260
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:34,218
- Did you forget your laundry?
- She's been on me to stop by for dinner.

261
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:36,848
Now, here's the plan.
We go in. We eat.

262
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:39,138
We out before the cheesecake.
You got it?

263
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:42,478
- I'm, what, your exit strategy?
- You can stay out here if you want.

264
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:44,808
That gives me a better excuse
to leave earlier,

265
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:46,978
or you can come in
and have some free food.

266
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:48,268
It's your call.

267
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,818
Shit.

268
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:53,238
My sisters are here, too.

269
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:01,158
Fucking family reunion.

270
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:06,128
This john comes out of nowhere.
He's got me by the throat.

271
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:09,998
I can't reach around and get my gun,
and I see he has a nipple ring.

272
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:12,838
I rip that fucker out
like it's a grenade pin.

273
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:13,878
Morgan.

274
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,338
Oh, I'm sorry. Cop mouth.

275
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:16,678
We're used to it.

276
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,468
When James graces his family
with his presence.

277
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,058
Some of us don't work at a bank.

278
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:25,228
First words out of my
baby brother's mouth were,

279
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:26,858
"Got milk, motherfucker?"

280
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:29,728
Oh, OK, now, that's enough, all of you.

281
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:31,688
That security guard is gonna be all right?

282
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,528
If someone did a hatchet job on me,
I'd cash it all in.

283
00:21:34,658 --> 00:21:35,858
Yeah, Tony's doing OK.

284
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:39,028
The hospital's setting him up
with some prosthetics.

285
00:21:39,158 --> 00:21:41,908
He's just got this spirit about him.

286
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:45,118
The guy's missing body parts
because of this ice-truck killer,

287
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:46,958
and he's still hitting on me.

288
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:50,418
That's because men only think
with one body part,

289
00:21:50,548 --> 00:21:52,548
and that one was not cut off.

290
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,258
Well, it's the damn truth.

291
00:21:55,378 --> 00:21:57,798
Morgan, come on.
We got a case to solve.

292
00:21:57,928 --> 00:22:01,218
Oh, are you sure, honey?
I got some cheesecake in the fridge.

293
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:03,728
Yeah. We're sure.

294
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:07,688
You know...
I would love some cheesecake.

295
00:22:07,808 --> 00:22:09,858
You can wait in the car.
That's your call.

296
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:13,398
He'll wait.

297
00:22:13,528 --> 00:22:16,028
I'll help you.
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:22,078
I wonder, in time,
if they'll even remember me,

299
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:25,998
other than the man
who broke their mother's heart.

300
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,748
I'll be breaking their hearts, too.

301
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:34,668
He is their father. They have a right to know
he's been released, right?

302
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:37,968
Yeah, sure.

303
00:22:38,088 --> 00:22:42,598
Even if I tell Paul not to come,
he'll show up here eventually.

304
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:43,968
I know him.

305
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:46,888
Everything's been going so good at work...

306
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:49,348
With you.

307
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:51,608
I don't know what to do.

308
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:54,818
He's really got a hold on you, doesn't he?

309
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:01,778
Paul always had a temper,
but when he was using...

310
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:05,578
He said if I left, he would find us
and hurt the kids.

311
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:10,078
Somehow, I thought that by staying,
I was protecting them.

312
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:16,258
Cody doesn't remember the worst of it,
but Astor...

313
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:21,588
She was the one who called
the police the last time.

314
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:23,758
She was protecting me.

315
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:29,188
You're not that woman anymore.
You're stronger than that now.

316
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:32,808
If their dad shows up,
we'll deal with it together.

317
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:36,648
Dad's coming home?

318
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:45,448
Can he sleep in my room, Mom?
Can he, Mom?

319
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:47,868
I shouldn't even be here.

320
00:23:47,998 --> 00:23:50,328
Rita will be devastated if I'm arrested.

321
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:53,378
Her husband was a crackhead,
and her boyfriend's a serial killer.

322
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,458
It's kind of hard
not to take that personally.

323
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:04,218
Better get inside, son.
Storm's on its way.

324
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:46,928
Why didn't you tell me
what you are, Dex?

325
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:16,578
Any last words?

326
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:20,668
Figures.

327
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:37,938
I don't have bad dreams.

328
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,228
When I sleep, all of me sleeps.

329
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:43,318
Nothing ever goes bump
in Dexter's night.

330
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:55,078
I've never felt a moment
of remorse, doubt, regret.

331
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:01,127
What's happening to me?

332
00:26:05,257 --> 00:26:06,797
If my back wasn't against the wall,

333
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:10,807
I'd almost feel guilty for
hacking into Masuka's email.

334
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:13,767
Once I got past all the porn, it was easy.

335
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:18,517
And there I am.

336
00:26:18,647 --> 00:26:20,817
Dr. Patrick Bateman -

337
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:24,277
so wholesome, so inconspicuous.

338
00:26:24,397 --> 00:26:26,447
Harry would frown upon
destroying evidence,

339
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,487
but he never wanted me
to get caught, either.

340
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:30,617
What are you doing in here?

341
00:26:30,737 --> 00:26:34,657
My computer went down.
I was just checking some email.

342
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:39,127
Can you take a look at this for me?

343
00:26:40,957 --> 00:26:44,047
- Copycat killer?
- I worked all night on that profile.

344
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,507
I'd like to give it to LaGuerta,

345
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:50,007
- but I want to make sure it's good enough.
- I'm honored.

346
00:26:51,597 --> 00:26:54,267
"The similar manner in which
the body was displayed

347
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:58,937
"suggests this killer feels a connection
to the ice-truck killer.

348
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:01,727
"Excited by what he's doing.

349
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:09,447
"The cut on the victim's cheek,
while not fatal,

350
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,697
"appears to be a signature of sorts.

351
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:15,787
"Because of the lack of evidence
collected from the crime scene,

352
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:20,877
"the suspect may be familiar with
law enforcement or forensics procedure."

353
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:26,377
Why'd you quit?
You're getting to the good stuff.

354
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:29,257
Let me guess -
single white male, mid-30s, lives alone,

355
00:27:29,377 --> 00:27:31,757
disconnected from his emotions.

356
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:38,177
- It's a little textbook, don't you think?
- But it totally fits this case.

357
00:27:38,307 --> 00:27:39,977
You're trying to make it fit.

358
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:46,727
My advice?
Keep this to yourself.

359
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:51,237
- Really?
- Deb, you're new to Homicide.

360
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:54,617
This blows up in your face,
you've given LaGuerta the excuse

361
00:27:54,737 --> 00:27:56,117
to send you back to Vice.

362
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:07,757
No. I'm onto something here. I feel it.

363
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:09,797
Like one of your hunches.

364
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:15,297
Way to have my back.

365
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:24,057
Where's your sister?

366
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:30,487
Debra, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

367
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,277
How did you get into my cabinet?

368
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:40,617
You hide the key in the pantry
on the top shelf.

369
00:28:40,747 --> 00:28:44,997
You and your brother know
never to touch my guns

370
00:28:45,127 --> 00:28:47,127
unless it's under my direct supervision.

371
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:48,627
But I was being really careful.

372
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:51,257
I mean, I was only shooting
at the cans and the bottles.

373
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:53,127
And I'm really good, like Dexter,

374
00:28:53,257 --> 00:28:56,297
and now we can all go hunting together.

375
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:58,097
I'm disappointed in you, Debra.

376
00:28:59,427 --> 00:29:01,017
Grab your things.

377
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,607
Thanks a lot.

378
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:15,157
Starting this morning,
we have cadets from the Academy

379
00:29:15,277 --> 00:29:17,987
going over every inch of the salvage yard.

380
00:29:18,117 --> 00:29:19,157
Those days I don't miss.

381
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:22,997
The kid we found yesterday
saw someone abduct Valerie Castillo.

382
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:25,917
Because he didn't recognize
a photo of Jorge Castillo,

383
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:29,457
Lieutenant LaGuerta is bringing him in
to attempt a sketch.

384
00:29:33,127 --> 00:29:34,337
Come on, sweetheart.

385
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:36,797
Let's take the seatbelt off.

386
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:39,007
There you go. Come on.

387
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:40,387
Come on, sweetheart.

388
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:42,557
You want to go inside
to see the nice lady?

389
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:44,977
Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

390
00:29:46,477 --> 00:29:47,937
Thanks for bringing him by.

391
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:02,787
Normally, I wouldn't approve
of something like this,

392
00:30:02,907 --> 00:30:05,327
but you've made quite an impression.

393
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:10,837
- You have kids?
- No.

394
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:16,047
I was like him once.
A stranger in a strange place,

395
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:20,467
left to grow up with strangers,
all for a better life.

396
00:30:22,177 --> 00:30:25,347
Well, police lieutenant,
I'd say you've done OK.

397
00:30:26,517 --> 00:30:30,357
- Any luck with the family?
- No. He talks about an uncle Roberto.

398
00:30:30,477 --> 00:30:34,067
- He just uses the first name.
- Maybe we'll have some luck on our end.

399
00:30:34,187 --> 00:30:35,397
I hope so.

400
00:30:35,527 --> 00:30:38,447
I hate to send another one into foster care.

401
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:41,697
Thank you.

402
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:43,907
Bye, sweetheart.

403
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:49,667
Meanwhile, we'll follow up
on the D.E.A. list of M-99 buyers.

404
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:55,257
That would include vets, doctors,
animal control, even circuses.

405
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:57,927
Be thorough. Check everyone.

406
00:30:58,047 --> 00:31:01,047
Masuka, what do we have
on the home and the boat?

407
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:03,137
Still processing, sir.

408
00:31:03,267 --> 00:31:07,437
If the husband is a dead end,
then we're looking at a new suspect, folks.

409
00:31:07,557 --> 00:31:10,937
Morgan, any ideas?

410
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,397
Don't do it, Deb.

411
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:17,277
The last thing I need right now
is to be profiled for all of Miami Metro.

412
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:20,867
We could be looking at someone
who's inspired by the ice-truck killer.

413
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:24,327
If so, the suspect is probably familiar
with forensic procedures.

414
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:26,657
I have a profile.
I'd be happy to show it to you.

415
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:28,407
I'll be in my lab.

416
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:31,917
Hello, Dex.

417
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:05,447
I'll be right back.

418
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:06,577
No.

419
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:33,897
I forgot how much I loved
pastelitos growing up.

420
00:32:34,017 --> 00:32:36,357
He just needed
a little reminder of home.

421
00:32:36,477 --> 00:32:39,527
I was barely his age
when I came over with my family.

422
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:41,647
I threw up the whole damn way.

423
00:32:50,457 --> 00:32:52,617
Go get the artist.
I think somebody's ready.

424
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:54,377
Save me some.

425
00:33:27,827 --> 00:33:30,617
Did you thank Mrs. Carroll
for picking you up from school for me?

426
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:32,197
Yes.

427
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:42,127
So, what do you think?

428
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,677
Everything OK?

429
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:48,757
You want to talk about it?

430
00:33:48,887 --> 00:33:52,097
Holly, Blake, and Ashley said
they can't come to my party.

431
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:55,597
Honey, that's not true.
I spoke with their moms last week.

432
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:56,767
It's all Cody's fault.

433
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:59,817
He couldn't keep his mouth shut
about dad getting out of jail.

434
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:03,687
- Did not!
- You told everyone!

435
00:34:13,407 --> 00:34:14,997
I have to know.

436
00:34:20,877 --> 00:34:23,587
Dexter...

437
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:26,927
Thank God. My arm's asleep.

438
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:31,807
- How long have you two been like this?
- Half an hour.

439
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:34,597
I was afraid I'd wake him if I moved.

440
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,977
At that age,
when they're out, they're out.

441
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:43,147
You could brush his teeth,
and he wouldn't wake up.

442
00:34:44,317 --> 00:34:48,067
Here. Lift up his head.
I'll slide this underneath.

443
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:06,507
Oh, thanks.

444
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:11,007
What are you doing here?

445
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:14,137
I'm waiting on some lab work.
I had some time to kill.

446
00:35:16,057 --> 00:35:19,057
Go ahead.
We didn't get very far. He's so tired.

447
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:21,977
We're gonna pick it up again tomorrow.

448
00:35:22,107 --> 00:35:28,277
It's only a matter of time before we know
what this little guy saw.

449
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:51,677
Come on.

450
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:05,727
If you... Here.

451
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,687
You want help or not?

452
00:36:09,697 --> 00:36:13,067
I have a hair or something
stuck on my lens.

453
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:14,277
You're in good hands.

454
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:17,077
I traded my glasses in
for contacts in high school.

455
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:18,077
Boys?

456
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:20,247
Yeah. What I really needed was tits.

457
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:22,537
I had Winnie the Poohs
on my bras until I was 16.

458
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:25,706
As you can see, not a whole
lot's changed since then.

459
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,416
Try not to blink, OK?

460
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:31,426
OK, OK. I'll do it.

461
00:36:31,546 --> 00:36:33,586
I'll do it.

462
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:38,596
Let me ask you something.
Your brother's adopted, right?

463
00:36:38,726 --> 00:36:40,846
Yeah, my dad found him
at a crime scene.

464
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:44,606
How did the department feel about Harry
getting personally involved in a case?

465
00:36:44,726 --> 00:36:47,316
It didn't seem to be a problem.
My parents never talked about it.

466
00:36:47,436 --> 00:36:50,896
Oh, but still, raising a boy,
it's a lot of work, no?

467
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:53,066
God, no.

468
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:55,866
I got in more trouble than he did.
He was the perfect one.

469
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:57,906
Here, I think I see it.

470
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:00,946
Yeah.

471
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:03,576
There's the bastard.

472
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:07,086
Thanks.

473
00:37:13,426 --> 00:37:15,086
Let me ask you a question.

474
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:18,096
Why do you have it in for me?

475
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:23,306
You're loud, impulsive,
and constantly question authority.

476
00:37:25,806 --> 00:37:27,266
Fair enough.

477
00:37:29,106 --> 00:37:31,276
I hear you have an interesting theory on...

478
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,906
The report on scandal-plagued
AFL's transactions in Florida

479
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:43,326
showed Transportation Department employees

480
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:47,876
received more than $460 in gifts,
ranging from golf balls and free dinners...

481
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:49,126
Honey, what is it?

482
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:52,916
...In return for buying supplies
worth $7,000...

483
00:37:58,136 --> 00:37:59,806
Sweetie.

484
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:02,216
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

485
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,016
It's all right. These things happen.

486
00:38:05,146 --> 00:38:07,976
Go get changed, and I'll fix the bed.

487
00:38:15,656 --> 00:38:17,866
Mommy?

488
00:38:17,986 --> 00:38:21,656
Is it OK if I didn't have my party?

489
00:38:54,686 --> 00:38:57,986
It's only a matter of time
before that boy tells the police

490
00:38:58,106 --> 00:39:01,406
who he saw that night
at the salvage yard - me.

491
00:39:02,236 --> 00:39:06,616
Once the sketch is finished,
there will be no place left to hide.

492
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:10,036
If I want any chance of survival,
I have to get rid of it all.

493
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:13,166
I have to let go.

494
00:39:50,576 --> 00:39:52,826
Alex Timmons - sniper.

495
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:58,126
Yes, I did it.
Is that what you want to hear?

496
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:03,136
Gene Marshall - arsonist.

497
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:06,716
Have you ever watched someone
burned alive?

498
00:40:08,136 --> 00:40:11,306
Cindy Landon - black widow.

499
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:13,806
I'll fuck you if you let me go.

500
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:16,646
Such fond memories of them all.

501
00:40:16,776 --> 00:40:19,816
They all accepted their fate
in their own way.

502
00:40:19,946 --> 00:40:22,316
Now it's time for me to do the same.

503
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:25,776
Valerie Castillo - my last victim.

504
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:39,086
He's not angry.
That's not what this is about.

505
00:40:39,216 --> 00:40:41,336
He's testing me.

506
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:45,596
I was wrong the whole time.

507
00:40:45,716 --> 00:40:48,516
My playmate saw an opportunity
to paint me into a corner

508
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:52,976
to see if I'd find my way out,
if I'd fight to survive.

509
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:21,416
If you have a well-preserved sample,

510
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:25,386
transferring a dry drop
of blood is relatively easy,

511
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:26,716
Almost as easy as it was

512
00:41:26,846 --> 00:41:31,676
lifting Jorge Castillo's fingerprints from
his boat and putting them on this knife.

513
00:42:03,716 --> 00:42:05,426
Just got off the phone with the FBI.

514
00:42:05,546 --> 00:42:06,676
Now for the hard part.

515
00:42:06,796 --> 00:42:09,176
I wanted to see what their computers
would spit out.

516
00:42:09,306 --> 00:42:12,176
I cross-referenced my profile
with the ice-truck killer list.

517
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:13,726
11 new hits.

518
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:18,436
How about we hold off till we get a sketch,
take it from there.

519
00:42:18,556 --> 00:42:19,516
I know, I know.

520
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:21,266
I want to get a head start on this.

521
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:23,896
We could look these over at lunch. My treat.

522
00:42:25,026 --> 00:42:27,856
You never give up, do you?

523
00:42:27,986 --> 00:42:30,236
Thank your mom for dinner the other night.

524
00:42:30,366 --> 00:42:34,196
Can't remember the last time I met
a guy's family and they actually liked me.

525
00:42:34,326 --> 00:42:35,456
You held your own.

526
00:42:35,576 --> 00:42:37,496
Most people don't get
a dirty word in edgewise

527
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:39,126
with my sisters around the table.

528
00:42:39,246 --> 00:42:43,666
In our house, every Thursday night was
pancake night - Morgan tradition.

529
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,926
I miss that kind of stuff, you know?

530
00:42:47,046 --> 00:42:48,466
I found something.

531
00:42:50,046 --> 00:42:51,466
The wife's blood?
You're sure?

532
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:54,306
This was found in
the Castillo's bedroom hamper.

533
00:42:54,426 --> 00:42:56,266
We check all the clothing items
that come in.

534
00:42:56,386 --> 00:42:58,346
Because of sheer volume,
that takes time.

535
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,896
- It doesn't prove anything.
- Not by itself.

536
00:43:01,016 --> 00:43:04,986
I've been re-examining the video footage
I took from that morning.

537
00:43:05,106 --> 00:43:08,276
Notice the cuts along the carotid arteries.
They're long and deep.

538
00:43:08,406 --> 00:43:09,986
Valerie Castillo bled to death in minutes.

539
00:43:10,116 --> 00:43:10,986
No shit.

540
00:43:11,116 --> 00:43:14,576
The person who did this
wasn't trying to emulate the ice-truck killer.

541
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:16,576
He was in a hurry.

542
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:19,876
- He was probably afraid of getting caught.
- Most killers are.

543
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:22,786
Except if this was a copycat,
he wouldn't be in a rush.

544
00:43:23,836 --> 00:43:25,336
He would savor his first kill.

545
00:43:25,466 --> 00:43:28,376
He would control the precise moment
Valerie Castillo died

546
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:30,836
instead of just letting her bleed out.

547
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:32,346
This is all too...

548
00:43:34,466 --> 00:43:37,636
passive.

549
00:43:37,766 --> 00:43:40,016
Have you completely ruled out the husband?

550
00:43:40,146 --> 00:43:42,016
Why are you doing this?

551
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:45,356
The boy said he didn't recognize
Jorge Castillo in any of the photos.

552
00:43:45,486 --> 00:43:47,486
He was a dehydrated
and traumatized seven-year-old

553
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:49,776
left to fend for himself
for days in a salvage yard.

554
00:43:49,906 --> 00:43:51,566
You really think it's the husband?

555
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:54,656
He's a deep-sea fisherman.
Most know how to use a knife.

556
00:43:54,786 --> 00:43:56,286
Plus, he's still missing.

557
00:43:59,786 --> 00:44:02,036
Have you finished your search
of the salvage yard?

558
00:44:03,496 --> 00:44:05,336
I'll have them send the cadets out again.

559
00:44:08,336 --> 00:44:09,926
Hey, I'm sorry.

560
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:14,216
I know how hard you worked on that profile.

561
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:16,676
No, Dex, I really don't think you do.

562
00:44:28,776 --> 00:44:30,486
How long are you grounded for?

563
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:33,906
Two months.

564
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:40,406
- Deb, I had to tell him.
- No, Dex, you didn't.

565
00:44:40,536 --> 00:44:43,076
You could have kept
your fucking mouth shut.

566
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:45,126
Dad was worried about you, and so was I.

567
00:44:45,246 --> 00:44:48,046
Well, now you can spend
more time together.

568
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:50,796
I'm not stupid, Dexter.
That's always what you wanted.

569
00:44:50,926 --> 00:44:52,006
No, it's not.

570
00:44:54,046 --> 00:44:58,136
- Deb, you're my sister.
- No, I am not.

571
00:44:58,266 --> 00:45:00,726
And he is my father.

572
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,596
There are so many times, I swear,

573
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:05,726
that I wish he would have
never brought you home.

574
00:45:09,066 --> 00:45:11,946
Dexter, I am so sorry.

575
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:15,446
I really, really didn't mean it like that.

576
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:22,616
Here.

577
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:26,496
I thought you might want that.

578
00:45:27,706 --> 00:45:29,876
You're a better shot than me anyway.

579
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:06,496
Hello?

580
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:08,496
Paul, hey, it's me.

581
00:46:08,626 --> 00:46:11,916
- Look, we need to talk.
- Sure thing.

582
00:46:12,046 --> 00:46:14,296
I know you want to see Astor,

583
00:46:14,426 --> 00:46:18,886
but, I mean,
the kids are doing so well now.

584
00:46:19,006 --> 00:46:24,886
Maybe it would be a good idea
if you don't come to the party.

585
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:28,856
She is my daughter, too, Rita.
I have every right to be there.

586
00:46:28,976 --> 00:46:30,106
You know what? I'm sorry.

587
00:46:30,226 --> 00:46:32,646
I'm sorry, but I have full custody now,

588
00:46:32,776 --> 00:46:35,446
and you can't just drop in
on us like this anymore.

589
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:36,606
Now, I checked.

590
00:46:36,736 --> 00:46:38,526
The restraining order is still in effect.

591
00:46:38,656 --> 00:46:42,536
If you step one foot on this property,
the first call I'm gonna make is to the police.

592
00:46:42,656 --> 00:46:44,656
The second is to your parole officer.

593
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:10,145
I need a sergeant.

594
00:47:24,785 --> 00:47:26,535
I'll be right there.

595
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:40,295
The uncle called our office this morning.

596
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,215
He lives in Tampa.

597
00:47:43,885 --> 00:47:47,425
That's great. He should be with family.

598
00:47:47,555 --> 00:47:49,015
Can I take him home?

599
00:47:50,395 --> 00:47:51,725
We're good.

600
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:55,935
Thank you.

601
00:47:56,065 --> 00:47:59,565
Thank you for finding him, huh?
He's a very special boy.

602
00:47:59,695 --> 00:48:02,065
I know.

603
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:27,425
Lieutenant, you need to see this.

604
00:48:38,235 --> 00:48:39,145
You OK?

605
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:40,775
These contacts.

606
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:54,415
Wrecks like this
are usually sold for scrap.

607
00:48:54,535 --> 00:48:56,245
The husband stashes a knife inside

608
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:59,955
and lets a demo crew shred
the truck before we find it.

609
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:01,875
No more murder weapon.

610
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,885
- There's blood.
- Want to bet it's the wife's?

611
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:07,425
It's always the husband.
You were right all along.

612
00:49:07,555 --> 00:49:09,515
Shake it off, Morgan.
Homicide takes time.

613
00:49:09,635 --> 00:49:11,975
Deb will forgive me eventually.

614
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:13,225
That's who she is -

615
00:49:13,345 --> 00:49:16,435
bighearted, kind, nothing like me.

616
00:49:16,565 --> 00:49:19,525
LaGuerta thought
you should see this.

617
00:49:19,645 --> 00:49:23,145
That kid Oscar swears this is who he saw.

618
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:30,195
Son of a bitch.

619
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:31,405
Dex.

620
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,535
OK, I gave them Jorge's sock,

621
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:36,915
a knife with his prints,
and a drop of his wife's blood.

622
00:49:37,035 --> 00:49:40,875
Forensics trifecta like that
should trump a child's drawing...

623
00:49:41,005 --> 00:49:42,505
I hope.

624
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:53,225
Too fucking weird.

625
00:49:53,345 --> 00:49:54,935
Jesus Christ saved this kid.

626
00:49:55,055 --> 00:49:59,185
On his own for as long as Oscar was,
who's to say he didn't?

627
00:50:07,775 --> 00:50:11,235
When did lighting candles
become more fun than blowing them out?

628
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:14,325
Nice turnout.

629
00:50:14,455 --> 00:50:16,785
I called all the moms to assure them

630
00:50:16,915 --> 00:50:19,495
that Paul would not
be making an appearance.

631
00:50:20,915 --> 00:50:24,215
Do Astor and Cody know
that you told their dad not to come?

632
00:50:28,545 --> 00:50:30,005
After presents.

633
00:50:33,885 --> 00:50:35,225
Ready?

634
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:39,435
Make a wish, baby.

635
00:50:39,565 --> 00:50:41,765
Just don't tell anybody,
or it won't come true.

636
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:44,605
It already came true.
Dad's not here.

637
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:52,945
I want the middle piece.

638
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:54,115
OK.

639
00:50:54,245 --> 00:50:57,285
I was wrong about birthdays.

640
00:50:57,415 --> 00:51:00,335
Maybe the reason to celebrate
them is what they offer -

641
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:03,165
the hope of living to see another one.

642
00:51:05,085 --> 00:51:07,505
The thing about Deb forgiving me,

643
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:09,585
I better give her a few more days.

644
00:51:15,845 --> 00:51:18,475
I barely escaped getting caught this time.

645
00:51:19,185 --> 00:51:21,265
I realize now my days are numbered.

646
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:25,105
So I better make the most of them.

647
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:40,075
All along, I thought this was a game
my alter ego and I were playing.

648
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,955
But relationships change,

649
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:45,455
evolve,

650
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:46,965
and this one's getting deep.

651
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:57,845
Like Harry said in my dream...

652
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,142
...the storm's on its way.
