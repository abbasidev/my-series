1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,310
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,980
Open up, Perry, it's the police. Open up.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,230
Hey, Angel, I got him!

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,020
They really found the ice-truck killer?

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,530
I saw him, Dex. I chased him.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:20,199
The fun part was hanging them like cattle right
before I cut their throats.

7
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:21,659
Son of a bitch.

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,289
I have so many questions for him.

9
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:27,079
What was his message to me?

10
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:28,789
Now I need to know him.

11
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:30,669
Hi.

12
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:32,209
Fuck are you?

13
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:36,589
Paul Bennett, father on parole.

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,009
Dexter Morgan.

15
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:41,009
I can't think of anything clever to say.

16
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:45,769
Divorce papers. Sign them now, and I'll agree
to supervised visits twice a week.

17
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:47,769
You think you can
really make me back down?

18
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:49,768
Are you fucking my wife?

19
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:54,018
I just wish he'd go away.

20
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:56,438
Why can't he just go
away and disappear forever?

21
00:00:56,568 --> 00:01:01,908
All along, I thought this was a game
my alter ego and I were playing.

22
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:09,038
But relationships change, evolve,
and this one's getting deep.

23
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:12,578
I realize now my days are numbered.

24
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,498
So I'd better make the most of them.

25
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:19,468
Your instincts were dead-on.

26
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:23,137
They're always dead-on when it
comes to killers. Why is that?

27
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,847
I'm watching you.

28
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:30,133
- What are we looking at here?
- I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing.

29
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:33,973
- You?
- No, it looks like a lobster. See the claws?

30
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:40,223
Why do bloodstains always
look like crustaceans to you?

31
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,353
I like seafood.

32
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:44,983
Rorschach would say you have
a hard time relating to others.

33
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:49,193
- Not as hard as her.
- It does look like a suicide.

34
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,153
Can I get some light in here, please?

35
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,733
- Damn power outages.
- I don't know, Angel.

36
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:55,533
Most firearm suicides
are committed by men.

37
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:59,032
Women slash their wrists, take pills, something
more ladylike.

38
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:00,072
Not in Miami.

39
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:04,162
We closed a couple of suicide cases
just like this last year, remember?

40
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:13,172
- Look at this mess.
- That's a fancy bathtub. Rich husband?

41
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:16,132
Househusband and aspiring artist.

42
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,222
- Promising. So, she supported him?
- It looks like that.

43
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,222
She was some kind of big-time prosecutor.

44
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:26,232
Those other suicides we closed, those were
high-powered women, too, right?

45
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:28,231
I don't know. I think so.

46
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,361
Note to self.

47
00:04:32,901 --> 00:04:35,071
I don't care what it looks like.
Somebody killed her.

48
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,241
We're checking out all the possibilities.

49
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,781
Was your wife dealing
with any emotional problem?

50
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:44,291
You know, job stress, the usual,
but she was working through it in therapy.

51
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:46,911
She have any other problems
that you're aware of?

52
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,001
Are you listening to me?
Vanessa didn't kill herself.

53
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,631
Criminals stage suicides.
Maybe one of the guys that she put away.

54
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,761
- We'll check into it.
- We need your clothes for evidence.

55
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,721
Standard procedure.

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,770
I got to go.
There's a dead body in the house.

57
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,610
There's a hot body in here.

58
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,940
I so want to maul you right now.

59
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,240
I so want you to.
Call me when you're done, OK?

60
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,490
Yeah, I'll bring handcuffs.

61
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,589
Morgan, what took you so long?

62
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:37,049
Playing Hide the Salami
with Mr. Prosthetics?

63
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,419
- I don't fuck and tell.
- Since when?

64
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,219
Can we go inside?
I'm kind of wet.

65
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:42,679
Don't.

66
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:47,059
See what you can find out about
the victim's relationship with her husband.

67
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:50,479
- It's always the husband, right?
- Looks like a suicide, but you never know.

68
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,059
Younger guy, unemployed. Maybe he was
a boy toy, killed her for her money.

69
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,649
I'm on it.

70
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,819
He is sending you away
from a crime scene in the rain,

71
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:01,279
and you're not putting up a fight?

72
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,358
- I'm a team player.
- You are?

73
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,328
Fuck you!

74
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,958
Hey, Dex, come on in.

75
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,248
- Where's Rita?
- She's stuck in traffic.

76
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,338
Power's out in half the city.

77
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:22,758
Of course, I love the extra kid time, but

78
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:26,468
court supervisor - not so much.

79
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:32,598
Hey, you know, I feel really bad
about the last time I was here.

80
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:35,017
I didn't mean to get
all Alpha male on you.

81
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:39,437
What are you supposed to say to the guy
who's f'ing your wife while you're in jail?

82
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:44,607
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

83
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,027
- Thanks for holding down the fort.
- Do you mind if I get going?

84
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,447
- I got kids of my own at home to look after.
- No, it's OK.

85
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,417
- Dexter and I are here now.
- Thanks. Bye, kids.

86
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:57,247
- Mom, Dexter, the lights are out.
- They are?

87
00:06:57,377 --> 00:07:00,417
- Hey, I brought hot chocolate.
- Dad already made us some.

88
00:07:00,547 --> 00:07:02,507
With extra marshmallows.

89
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:04,426
Tag. You're it!

90
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:05,886
I'd love some hot chocolate.

91
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:10,096
Take two. Looks like he's got extra.
Come here, buddy.

92
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:15,096
Mom, can Dad stay
and put us to bed, please?

93
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,436
- I think that's why Dexter's here, sweetie.
- Dexter doesn't mind.

94
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:22,436
Only a song, no story.
It's way past your bedtime.

95
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:26,406
All right, bedbugs,
let's leave these two alone.

96
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:28,656
It's not like they need a chaperone.

97
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,705
Meghan Dowd, Carolyn Jillian,
and now Vanessa Gayle,

98
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:47,295
all three powerful women, all three
shot themselves in the past two years.

99
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:52,425
They've got to have more in common than
career ambition and fondness for firearms.

100
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,805
Why the sudden interest in suicides?

101
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:58,265
Morbid curiosity.

102
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,605
What can I do for you?

103
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:02,515
So many things.

104
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:05,185
I need the blood-spatter report
on Vanessa Gayle.

105
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:11,984
Blood spatter's inconclusive.
All I can tell is she was shot at close range.

106
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:15,614
- I wish I had more for you.
- Me too.

107
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:20,284
Maria, the D.A. needs the work sheet
for the ice-truck killer case.

108
00:08:20,414 --> 00:08:23,414
I'm working on it.
When'd you talk to the D.A.?

109
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,794
We had dinner last night.

110
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:30,254
Mayor Allen took us out to celebrate
Neil Perry's arrest. Hell of a good time.

111
00:08:33,464 --> 00:08:36,924
I'm the one who gets Perry to confess,
and he's got the mayor kissing his ass.

112
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:38,133
I wouldn't be too upset.

113
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:40,683
Matthews will be the one
with the egg on his face.

114
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:44,473
- You still believe we got the wrong guy?
- Perry's the pretender to the throne.

115
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:48,103
The real king is still out there,
and he'll kill again. It's a matter of time.

116
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:51,653
Or the ice-truck killer will use Perry
as a get out of jail free card.

117
00:08:55,193 --> 00:08:56,993
You really think that might happen?

118
00:08:57,113 --> 00:09:02,573
If Perry's the wrong guy
and we let him take the fall, definitely.

119
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:04,793
Thanks, Dexter.

120
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:10,002
What if LaGuerta's right?
What if the ice-truck killer does disappear?

121
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:16,342
No. He's got unfinished business with me.

122
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:20,472
Still, I can't just sit on my hands
waiting for something to happen.

123
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:22,802
I need a distraction.

124
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:29,482
Nothing like some little Debbies and
a worthy new adversary to clear my head.

125
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:37,072
Talk to me, ladies.

126
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:39,952
What do you have in common?

127
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:44,031
Same sorority? Pilates instructor?

128
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:04,301
Dr. Emmett Meridian.

129
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:12,190
The three suicide sisters
shared the same therapist,

130
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,560
Dr. Emmett Meridian.

131
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,730
He must be terrible at his job.

132
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,910
So far, he comes up squeaky clean,

133
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,630
no malpractice suits,
no disgruntled patients.

134
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,130
And I thought I was a master
at damage control.

135
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,420
Perhaps I should schedule
a session with the good doctor

136
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,090
and try out a little reverse psychology.

137
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,589
Come on in, Sean. Have a seat.

138
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:48,179
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

139
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:50,679
I expect the police
to show up when I call, right?

140
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:53,889
The least I can do is clear
my lunch hour for a cop in need.

141
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,729
So, what brought you here?

142
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,439
A friend of mine died.

143
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:05,069
She killed herself.

144
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,529
I need to understand why.

145
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:09,989
How come?

146
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,949
She had everything going for her.
It doesn't make sense.

147
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,288
To some people,
death makes perfect sense.

148
00:11:15,418 --> 00:11:17,878
Life - now, that's the puzzle.

149
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:19,838
Like you, Sean.

150
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,298
What really brought you here?

151
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:26,138
- I just told you I came...
- ...to talk about your friend's suicide, I know.

152
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:30,098
I think you're using this suicide deal
as an excuse to come see me.

153
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,388
You're absolutely right.

154
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:40,478
How could you tell?

155
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:43,938
I'm sensing you do it a lot
to keep the world at arm's length.

156
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:47,817
And what are my real intentions?

157
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:56,917
As soon as I pay for my lunch,
you're gonna tell me that.

158
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:58,457
Excuse me a second.

159
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,497
Judging from what I've seen
so far, I probably will.

160
00:12:01,627 --> 00:12:03,377
This guy's good.

161
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:06,627
So why do his patients keep dying?

162
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:13,017
Vanessa's estimated time of death
was Monday at seven p.m.

163
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:15,767
Meridian was in session
with Scott Solomon.

164
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:18,806
I wonder if Mr. Solomon kept
his appointment that night.

165
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:28,156
So, we got almond chicken,
and pork fried rice.

166
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:32,236
- Let's start with the basics. You married?
- No.

167
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:35,286
- Girlfriend?
- Yes.

168
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:36,456
Sex life?

169
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:39,536
It's personal.

170
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,376
And this is therapy,
where we share personal things.

171
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:50,335
You know, it might help me open up
if you shared something about yourself.

172
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:52,045
Why did you become a psychiatrist?

173
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:57,595
See what you just did?
Trying to take control like that?

174
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:01,555
You probably get away with it
most of the time, right?

175
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:05,565
That's a way of preventing other people
from getting close to you.

176
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,815
May I ask you something, Sean?

177
00:13:12,945 --> 00:13:14,865
Have you ever been close to anybody?

178
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:21,534
My foster father.

179
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:25,834
He's the only one
who ever really knew me.

180
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:28,414
You're adopted?

181
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:31,334
Harry took me in when I was three.

182
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:37,304
So tell me about Harry. What kind of stuff
did you guys do together?

183
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:39,844
You know, normal father/son stuff.

184
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,734
All right. Stop. Enough.

185
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:58,073
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

186
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:00,283
Nice ambush.

187
00:14:00,413 --> 00:14:02,453
That was the perfect point of attack.

188
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:06,203
I can't believe I finally got you. I won.

189
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:11,163
- This isn't a game, Dexter.
- No, I know.

190
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:14,793
- It's not supposed to be fun.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's just...

191
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,383
You think I want to teach you these things?

192
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:20,803
This is the only way I know
how to keep you out of an electric chair.

193
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:25,352
This is about survival, Dex, nothing else.

194
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:27,762
Got it?

195
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:46,282
You've got a visitor, Perry.

196
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:49,582
- Miss me?
- Don't flatter yourself.

197
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:52,872
I have to comb through your case
before the trial,

198
00:14:53,002 --> 00:14:56,631
make sure I have my facts straight
on the notorious ice-truck killer.

199
00:14:57,961 --> 00:15:00,421
I confessed. What more do you need?

200
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:01,671
The evidence to line up.

201
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,761
We haven't matched your prints against
the partial on the lozenge wrapper

202
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:07,181
we found at the abandoned hospital.

203
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:10,471
Liquid nitrogen,
I use it to freeze the body parts.

204
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:13,561
It's extremely effective,
but it burns like a bitch.

205
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:18,611
Or you knew your prints wouldn't match,

206
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:22,401
so you purposely burned
your fingertips to hide it.

207
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,281
Are you suggesting that I'm a liar?

208
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:27,990
Just covering my bases, Neil.
We both want the same thing.

209
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
Ten minutes alone with Angelina?

210
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,500
To see you convicted.

211
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,170
What's in it for me if I help you do your job?

212
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,300
How about immortality?

213
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,220
We found your mother's body
under your house.

214
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,190
Now, you can go down
as a pathetic loser who killed Mom

215
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,729
or the most heinous killer in Florida's history.

216
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:04,649
Your choice.

217
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:14,159
If I'm going to become a legend,
I need to be memorialized.

218
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,369
I want a reporter here
to interview me. Front page.

219
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:19,539
You're not allowed to talk
to the press before the trial.

220
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:26,549
If you want me to cooperate,
I'm sure you'll find a way.

221
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:37,478
Meridian had one thing right.
I do crave control.

222
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:42,398
The longer the ice-truck killer maintains
radio silence, the less control I have.

223
00:16:43,778 --> 00:16:48,318
Craigslist. It's desperate, I know, but apropos,

224
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:51,318
personal ads are filled with desperation.

225
00:16:51,448 --> 00:16:55,328
"Tyler from Key West.
Speedos tanning on the beach.

226
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,498
"Touched your tits on Friday night."

227
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,957
At least these folks aren't just standing by

228
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:03,547
waiting for something
to happen, and neither am I.

229
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:09,887
"Dear Ken, I'm in pieces.

230
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:14,007
"Why the cold shoulder?
Love, Barbie."

231
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:32,156
Hey, I got it.

232
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:37,366
- Thanks.
- Hey, I know you. Monday night at Meridian's.

233
00:17:37,496 --> 00:17:40,116
You're always leaving your seven o'clock
when I'm arriving for my eight o'clock.

234
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:43,336
- You missed last week, right?
- No, I was there.

235
00:17:43,456 --> 00:17:46,706
- I don't remember ever seeing you, though.
- How do you like him?

236
00:17:46,836 --> 00:17:48,216
Meridian?

237
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:50,336
Best thing that's ever happened to me...

238
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,836
So far.

239
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:55,256
How about you? You finding him helpful?

240
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:57,886
I'm a sociopath.
There's not much he can do for me.

241
00:17:58,016 --> 00:18:00,516
Cute and funny.

242
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,555
Let me guess - taken.

243
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:05,515
- Girlfriend.
- Lucky girl.

244
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:08,485
Well, thanks for the help,
but I can handle it from here.

245
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:09,815
All right.

246
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:13,025
So Meridian has an alibi for the time of death.

247
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:16,025
My sexual hang-ups
and control issues aside,

248
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:21,205
I need a follow-up appointment
to dig a little deeper.

249
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:24,165
Isn't that what therapy's all about?

250
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,244
Oh, my God.

251
00:19:00,364 --> 00:19:02,744
I love your body.

252
00:19:06,663 --> 00:19:09,043
I love your legs.

253
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:12,713
I love your arms.

254
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,043
I couldn't have made them better myself.

255
00:19:22,223 --> 00:19:23,803
Are you crying?

256
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:26,893
I'm fine.

257
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:30,933
Then what?

258
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:34,902
I don't know.

259
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:41,192
I'm sure this is really hot, crying after sex.

260
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:44,612
Everything about you is hot.

261
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,412
Tell me what you're feeling.

262
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,082
It's...

263
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,252
It's just...

264
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:04,092
Every time I've ever
been naked with someone...

265
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:09,101
...we just fuck.

266
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:13,891
But not this time?

267
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:17,021
It's different.

268
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:18,651
It feels like...

269
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:24,491
I hate saying this.
It sounds so fucking cheesy.

270
00:20:24,611 --> 00:20:27,741
It feels like making love.

271
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:33,911
Yes.

272
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,380
But promise me you'll never say that again.

273
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,760
What if I do? Are you gonna cry about it?

274
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
You're so fucked up.

275
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,010
What's up, rock star?

276
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,310
Look at you. What you doing? Hey.

277
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,520
Where's the supervisor?

278
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,730
Oh, she called on my cell and canceled.

279
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,240
Who wants to play Monster Tag?

280
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,320
- I do.
- Yeah?

281
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,530
I'm coming after you.

282
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:10,869
You better run.

283
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:13,539
You know you're not
allowed unsupervised visits.

284
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:16,619
I know. Big bad Paul needs a baby-sitter.

285
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:18,829
It's your day off, right?

286
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:23,209
Now, would it really be so terrible
if we spent time with our kids together?

287
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:27,259
- I have a lunch date with Dexter.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

288
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:30,339
Mom, Dad, come on.

289
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:39,099
I guess I could call Dexter.

290
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:42,398
It's official. I'm nominating
you for Mom Of The Year.

291
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:47,188
Here comes the monster.
Here comes the monster.

292
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,578
Contrary to what Dr. Meridian thinks,

293
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:58,248
I don't always keep others at a distance.

294
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:00,788
Things are looking up already.

295
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:04,458
"Hey, Barbie. How'd you like to suck my cock?"

296
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:06,758
Or not.

297
00:22:06,878 --> 00:22:10,798
Clearly nobody here is
my missing partner in crime.

298
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:14,007
Hey, what's up?
You were looking for me?

299
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:16,467
What did forensics come back
with on Vanessa Gayle?

300
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:19,177
Gunpowder on her hand,
none on her husband's,

301
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:22,097
high-angle trajectory,
drugs in the tox screen.

302
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:25,607
- It all points to suicide.
- No chance it was murder?

303
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:28,187
Too bad, huh?
I had the husband pegged, too.

304
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:30,647
Was hoping he could help me
score my own sugar mama.

305
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:31,777
Try Craigslist.

306
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:36,197
I already did,
nothing but cat ladies and saggy tits.

307
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:45,336
Miami Metro can close this case
as a suicide, but I'm still not convinced.

308
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:48,916
Maybe my new therapist can shed
some light on my doubts.

309
00:22:50,756 --> 00:22:52,756
You seem on edge today.

310
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:58,386
- I'm not getting what I came here for.
- What'd you come here for?

311
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:02,476
We established in our last visit
that it wasn't to talk about suicide.

312
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:06,106
- Or feelings.
- Heaven forbid.

313
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:09,606
- So, what do you want to talk about?
- Fakes.

314
00:23:11,946 --> 00:23:14,655
People who pass themselves off
as something they're not.

315
00:23:14,775 --> 00:23:18,075
- Like a pre-owned-car salesman?
- A brave politician.

316
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:22,785
- A Jew for Jesus.
- A wolf in sheep's clothing.

317
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:25,955
Is that how you feel, Sean?

318
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:31,005
- Like you're hiding a dark secret?
- No, I wasn't talking about me.

319
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,915
Who were you talking about?

320
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:41,925
You.

321
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,844
That's a common first-time
reaction to therapy.

322
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:47,854
You think I can't care about you,

323
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:50,894
that I'm only pretending to care
because I have another motive.

324
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:53,694
- Bingo.
- You got me.

325
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:56,864
I do have another motive.
It's called a paycheck.

326
00:23:56,984 --> 00:24:00,694
But that doesn't mean that I can't care
for my patients or enjoy my job.

327
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:03,154
How are things at your job?

328
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:06,114
Frustrating, to tell you the truth.

329
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,284
- What kind of forensics do you do?
- Blood spatter.

330
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,994
Most people can't stand blood.

331
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:13,544
I hate it.

332
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:17,133
Categorizing and analyzing
must be very soothing for you.

333
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:21,713
Yeah, it is, actually.

334
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:24,723
So, OK, how are things with your girlfriend?

335
00:24:24,843 --> 00:24:27,263
She canceled lunch with me
to be with her ex-husband.

336
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:30,973
Sounds like things are out
of your control right now.

337
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:33,393
No wonder you cut yourself
off from your emotions.

338
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:35,563
That way you never have to feel powerless.

339
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:37,983
So, then, what should I do?

340
00:24:38,523 --> 00:24:42,113
Accept that certain things
are out of your hands. Let go.

341
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:47,453
Hey, Morgan. I can't believe,
out of two million sperm,

342
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,202
you were the fastest swimmer.

343
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,742
What are you gonna do about it?

344
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:54,412
I wanted to kill him, Dad.

345
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:58,172
It must have been tough
for you to walk away, son.

346
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:00,252
I'm proud that you did that.

347
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:03,302
Don't be, 'cause I still want to kill him.

348
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,632
When's that gonna go away?

349
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:10,802
I think I have everything
I need, Mr. Perry.

350
00:25:10,932 --> 00:25:12,262
When's the story gonna run?

351
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:15,432
Well, they're saving space
for tomorrow, front page.

352
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:17,442
I just got to get back and write.

353
00:25:17,562 --> 00:25:20,861
Thanks so much for your time.

354
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,941
- How was your interview?
- It was fine.

355
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:26,901
You ready to talk about the case?

356
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:30,951
Sure, as soon as I get
to talk to a reporter.

357
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:32,281
You just did.

358
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:33,621
Oh, give me a break.

359
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,661
That poser was one of your
cop buddies, but nice try.

360
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:41,381
In case you forgot, Neil,
you're the one in jail. I call the shots.

361
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:43,841
I could invoke my Miranda rights
at any time and lawyer up.

362
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:46,921
If you wanted a lawyer,
you'd have one by now.

363
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,010
I know your game, Lieutenant.

364
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,810
You think I'm a fraud
and you're trying to prove it,

365
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,480
but the truth is you're the fraud.

366
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,810
You know what, Neil?

367
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,980
I'm really not in the mood for your shit today.

368
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,780
I found out how you got promoted.

369
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,830
Back when you and Sergeant Doakes
were still partners,

370
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,120
Doakes got the drop on a major coke dealer,
brought you along for the ride.

371
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,499
How did you get...

372
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,839
When the perp bailed
from a third-story apartment,

373
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,039
Doakes took the fire escape,

374
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:28,129
sent you to cover the stairs just in case.

375
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:32,009
Only... you got lucky

376
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:36,389
and you made the headline grab,
and so the legend began.

377
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,639
I wonder if Doakes would have
made a good lieutenant.

378
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,439
- I deserved that promotion.
- I'm sure you did. It was a big bust.

379
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:50,819
Not as big as catching me, of course,
but, let's be honest.

380
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:55,118
You didn't catch me. Your captain did.

381
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:03,498
At least that's what
they're saying on the news.

382
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,928
My therapist wants me to accept
the things that are out of my hands.

383
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:18,308
Tragically for him, he's not out of my hands.

384
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,808
Not if I can find proof

385
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:24,807
that the death of at least three women
under his care was not a coincidence.

386
00:27:31,237 --> 00:27:32,817
Breaking and entering.

387
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:47,747
I hope he got my good side.

388
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:59,056
Now, what's he recording
for posterity's sake?

389
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:15,026
Goodbye, Dexter.

390
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,076
Hello, ladies.

391
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:23,406
I need another prescription.

392
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,785
I'm sorry, Vanessa. I can't do that.

393
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,495
Just one more, please.

394
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:34,005
We talked about this.

395
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:37,085
The antidepressants
were a temporary crutch

396
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,505
so that you could start
taking steps on your own.

397
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:44,015
But you don't understand.
I can't do this on my own.

398
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:46,765
I can't even get out of fucking bed.

399
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:54,105
I just... I want to die.

400
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,895
Look at me.

401
00:28:57,025 --> 00:29:00,064
I understand the appeal of death, OK?

402
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:02,824
No more pain.

403
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:06,284
All the career pressure,
the hopelessness, gone.

404
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:11,164
In many cultures, there's no stigma
attached to taking one's life.

405
00:29:11,294 --> 00:29:15,544
Suicide's respected, even revered
as a matter of personal conscience.

406
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,134
How do most people do it?

407
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:22,754
Well, painkillers are the most common.

408
00:29:22,884 --> 00:29:25,054
But they're entirely unreliable.

409
00:29:25,174 --> 00:29:28,514
The truly courageous of heart...

410
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,433
use guns.

411
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:37,273
You took women who trusted you
at their weakest possible moment,

412
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:40,813
but rather than help them,
you suggested they end it all.

413
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:44,363
God, you even gave them
permission to use a gun.

414
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:47,403
You're a mean one, Mr. Shrink.

415
00:29:47,533 --> 00:29:50,283
Create their drug addiction, pull them off,

416
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:54,203
then fill their addled heads
with noble thoughts of suicide.

417
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,123
I think I've had a breakthrough in therapy.

418
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:11,472
Hey, I got your texts. Is everything...

419
00:30:15,352 --> 00:30:17,062
...OK?

420
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,442
It is now.

421
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:23,272
OK, just, I wanted to see you.

422
00:30:23,402 --> 00:30:27,862
I felt bad about missing lunch
to be with Paul and the kids.

423
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,402
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea.

424
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:33,491
No, of course not.

425
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,291
How'd it go?

426
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:42,541
Really good and incredibly scary.

427
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:46,501
For the first time in a long while,
I saw how easy it would be

428
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:48,921
for me to fall back into my old life.

429
00:30:49,051 --> 00:30:50,511
Why is that scary?

430
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:55,181
Because... I like my new life.

431
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,721
And I finally feel like I'm in control.
I never felt that way with Paul.

432
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:01,851
I do with you.

433
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,860
This is a disaster.

434
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,200
I chose Rita because she was damaged.

435
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,030
If she gets better, I'll lose her for sure.

436
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm ready, Dexter.

437
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,139
I don't know what I've been so afraid of.

438
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:38,059
You're the perfect boyfriend.

439
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:46,769
I want you to spend the night, for real.

440
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,869
I'm so sorry.

441
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:00,999
I came over here because
I thought something was wrong.

442
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,619
But tonight's really not a good night.

443
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:08,788
I'm right in the middle of a case.
I'm way too distracted.

444
00:32:09,378 --> 00:32:11,838
Now? It's so late.

445
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:15,298
That's all the more reason to get back to work.

446
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:18,218
The clock's ticking.

447
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:19,968
Here.

448
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:26,308
But I'll call you tomorrow. OK?

449
00:32:28,228 --> 00:32:29,688
OK.

450
00:32:32,608 --> 00:32:33,858
Shit.

451
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:35,398
I can't have sex with Rita.

452
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:40,197
Every time I sleep with a woman,
she sees me for what I really am. Empty.

453
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:43,327
And then she's gone.

454
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:51,297
But I don't want Rita to go,
which means I have to deal with this.

455
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:55,877
I can't kill Meridian yet.
I need another therapy session.

456
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:15,816
Stay where you are. I'm armed.

457
00:33:17,906 --> 00:33:19,316
With bad puns?

458
00:33:24,956 --> 00:33:26,906
You said you needed a favor. What's up?

459
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:28,366
Take off your pants.

460
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:30,286
Oh, I should have known
it was that kind of favor.

461
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:34,506
- You never ask me to come by before work.
- No, but I like the way you think.

462
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:38,376
I have a patient who lost
both her legs in a car accident,

463
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:39,925
Really brutal.

464
00:33:40,045 --> 00:33:42,465
Like your mom?

465
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:45,635
Which is why I want to do
something special for her.

466
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:50,765
I want to give her a new smokin' pair of legs.

467
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,305
- Yours.
- No.

468
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:54,605
- Let me just take a cast.
- No way. No.

469
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:57,735
It'll take 20 minutes, tops.
Come on, please?

470
00:33:57,855 --> 00:34:01,115
Stop being such a chick.

471
00:34:01,235 --> 00:34:03,235
Sit down.

472
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,464
Feels good.

473
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:39,444
Can I make one of your cock?

474
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:42,153
That'd be a hell of a story
to tell the bullpen, huh?

475
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:45,113
Not likely.

476
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,943
I haven't told anyone about us.

477
00:34:47,073 --> 00:34:49,993
Embarrassed about banging Captain Hook?

478
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:54,033
- Not even a little.
- Then why?

479
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:59,213
I guess this matters to me.

480
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:03,003
So if I talk about it and it goes away,

481
00:35:03,133 --> 00:35:05,963
I'm actually losing something.

482
00:35:09,513 --> 00:35:10,593
Is that retarded?

483
00:35:13,762 --> 00:35:15,602
No.

484
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:20,352
I got to tell you, I'm not going anywhere.

485
00:35:20,482 --> 00:35:23,312
Seriously?

486
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:33,782
And neither are you,

487
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:36,282
'cause I got your leg.

488
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,341
Where the hell you been?

489
00:35:49,461 --> 00:35:52,721
- With my boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?

490
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:55,801
Yep. We just fucked in his office.

491
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:59,061
And we're having dinner tomorrow night.

492
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:03,191
- You looking for me?
- Yeah. Shut the door.

493
00:36:06,821 --> 00:36:11,241
Did you tell anyone about our bust,
the one that got me promoted?

494
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:12,701
No.

495
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:15,570
Nobody in the press?

496
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,740
Maria, we talked about this
when it happened.

497
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,540
It would fuck up your rep
and make me look like a whiny bitch.

498
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,290
It's bad for both of us.

499
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,420
So then the only way
to access that information

500
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,590
would be to read to police report, right?

501
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,630
I guess.

502
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,220
We have to have our firewall checked.

503
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,680
She was sitting on top of me,
basically naked...

504
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,060
...asking me to spend the night,

505
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,730
and I didn't know what to do.

506
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:49,609
It's OK, Sean. Don't beat yourself up.

507
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:53,819
Your girlfriend really means
something to you. I know that.

508
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:56,199
If she means something,
why did I run away from her?

509
00:36:56,319 --> 00:36:58,489
The same reason you work so hard
to shut everybody else out.

510
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,449
You're afraid they won't like what they see.

511
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:02,409
Yeah, I think you're right.

512
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:05,619
How can I change that?

513
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:07,749
Well, for starters, you accept the fact

514
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:11,129
that we all have a big, bad wolf
hiding inside of us,

515
00:37:11,249 --> 00:37:13,959
a darkness we don't want anyone else to see.

516
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:15,469
Do you?

517
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:17,219
Of course I do.

518
00:37:19,298 --> 00:37:20,298
Really?

519
00:37:21,928 --> 00:37:23,968
And how do you deal with your wolf?

520
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:27,848
Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.

521
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,898
I made friends with it.

522
00:37:31,608 --> 00:37:35,568
And now I just let it out
for a big meal once in a while.

523
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:38,948
At least three times that we know about.

524
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:42,868
Can we get back to the sex thing?

525
00:37:42,988 --> 00:37:44,158
This is all about sex.

526
00:37:44,288 --> 00:37:47,208
The reason you avoid sexual intimacy

527
00:37:47,328 --> 00:37:49,288
is because you don't want
to surrender control.

528
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,917
No, I've surrendered control.

529
00:37:51,037 --> 00:37:55,047
It's not like my girlfriend hasn't been,
you know, south of the border.

530
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:57,677
That's not what I'm talking about. Intimacy...

531
00:37:59,297 --> 00:38:01,677
Really letting go, face-to-face.

532
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:04,057
There's nothing more difficult than that.

533
00:38:04,177 --> 00:38:09,057
The minute you start to accept who you are,
you just might feel free enough

534
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,977
to share that intimacy together.

535
00:38:19,817 --> 00:38:20,946
What are you doing?

536
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,236
I'd like to talk you through
a deep-relaxation technique.

537
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:25,656
It might bring some things to the surface.

538
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:27,326
What kinds of things?

539
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:31,536
There must have been a time
in your life when you felt powerless.

540
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:35,706
Foster child, no control over your destiny.

541
00:38:35,836 --> 00:38:38,256
If we can bring some
of those memories to the surface,

542
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:40,046
we might find the root of your control issues.

543
00:38:40,176 --> 00:38:44,676
First, I want you to close your eyes
and focus on your breathing.

544
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:47,056
I want you to count each breath, OK?

545
00:38:47,176 --> 00:38:51,096
In, one, and out, two.

546
00:38:51,226 --> 00:38:53,055
Just give it a try.

547
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,935
This is ridiculous.
I could be killing him right now.

548
00:38:57,065 --> 00:38:58,735
Now I want you to think of a time

549
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:06,695
when you felt completely
and totally powerless.

550
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:16,085
Hey, Morgan. You still fucking your sister?

551
00:39:16,205 --> 00:39:17,625
Leave me alone, Josh.

552
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:28,054
I told you to walk away.

553
00:39:29,224 --> 00:39:30,924
God damn it, Dexter.

554
00:39:31,054 --> 00:39:33,804
There are consequences
to everything you do in life.

555
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:38,274
Lose control, become powerless, and it's over.

556
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:39,564
I found the grave, son.

557
00:39:39,684 --> 00:39:41,194
You're saying I'll be like this forever.

558
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:47,154
Mommy!

559
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:50,904
I have to get out of here.

560
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:53,864
Hey, hey. Sean, come here.

561
00:40:13,383 --> 00:40:15,593
Oh, my God.

562
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:21,143
Are you OK?

563
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:08,771
Stay. Stay with me.

564
00:42:14,419 --> 00:42:15,919
You're sweet.

565
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:20,389
I am?

566
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:23,929
Next time, we'll figure out
what to tell the kids

567
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,179
so you don't have to sneak out like this.

568
00:42:29,269 --> 00:42:32,108
You want there to be a next time?

569
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:35,278
And a time after that.

570
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:38,488
Don't you?

571
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:47,408
No. I mean, yeah.

572
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:49,538
I just...

573
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:55,298
I didn't freak you out?

574
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:59,758
Why would you think that?

575
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:03,347
Dexter, there's nothing you could ever do that
would scare me away.

576
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:19,487
I really hope you came to apologize.

577
00:43:19,607 --> 00:43:21,657
Nope. I came for a consult.

578
00:43:21,777 --> 00:43:24,067
And you brought beverages?

579
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:26,157
I got this on loan from the morgue.

580
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:29,117
Now, I could use an expert opinion,

581
00:43:29,247 --> 00:43:31,617
specifically, your expert opinion.

582
00:43:31,747 --> 00:43:35,126
See, we can't figure out

583
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,876
exactly how the killer cut off this head.

584
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:40,006
Can you?

585
00:43:40,126 --> 00:43:41,836
Nope.

586
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:45,006
Really? I think you can.

587
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:47,056
I mean, you chop people up, don't you?

588
00:43:47,176 --> 00:43:48,676
Maybe you need a closer look.

589
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:51,136
No. Keep it away.

590
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:59,026
I talked to the medical examiner.

591
00:43:59,146 --> 00:44:01,066
He couldn't confirm how your mom died.

592
00:44:01,196 --> 00:44:03,066
Said it might have been a heart attack.

593
00:44:03,196 --> 00:44:05,405
- I killed her.
- You don't have the balls.

594
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:08,365
I mean, you had to wait
till she died to chop her up.

595
00:44:08,485 --> 00:44:12,535
And even then you were too
squeamish to cut off her head.

596
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:16,075
Not exactly the same
as stuffing roadkill, is it?

597
00:44:16,205 --> 00:44:17,745
Oh, fuck you.

598
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:20,835
Serial killers get all the glory, don't they, Neil?

599
00:44:20,965 --> 00:44:23,255
Especially the ice-truck killer.

600
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:27,715
You know, you're not the first groupie
to take credit for someone else's work.

601
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,055
Oh, bullshit.

602
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:30,465
I know details about the case,

603
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:32,265
things that weren't
published in the newspapers.

604
00:44:32,385 --> 00:44:34,895
That's because you hacked
into our computer system.

605
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:36,894
I had the IT guys check our firewall.

606
00:44:37,014 --> 00:44:39,644
The DMZ was breached.
You read all our police reports.

607
00:44:39,774 --> 00:44:42,564
You even got yourself
a nice paneled car last month.

608
00:44:42,694 --> 00:44:43,894
Nice touch, by the way.

609
00:44:44,024 --> 00:44:45,234
Why are you doing this?

610
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:48,234
Because you're not a killer.

611
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:51,864
You're a coward and a fake, aren't you?

612
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,874
Maybe you need another look.

613
00:44:59,994 --> 00:45:02,124
No, take it away.

614
00:45:04,714 --> 00:45:08,043
All right, I lied, OK?

615
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:13,923
Just, I need you to take it away from me...

616
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:16,893
...please.

617
00:45:27,443 --> 00:45:29,443
So, what's on your mind, Lieutenant?

618
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:31,863
We got a lot to get done
before Perry's trial.

619
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:35,613
Yeah, about that trial,
I've got some bad news.

620
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:38,782
Perry recanted his confession this morning.

621
00:45:38,912 --> 00:45:40,702
What are you talking about?

622
00:45:40,832 --> 00:45:43,372
I was going over some details
with him at County,

623
00:45:43,502 --> 00:45:46,122
and he admitted that
he gave us a false confession.

624
00:45:47,382 --> 00:45:48,792
He's a wannabe, Tom.

625
00:45:48,922 --> 00:45:51,342
Just wanted his 15 minutes, that's all.

626
00:45:51,462 --> 00:45:53,422
How do you know which time he was lying?

627
00:45:55,262 --> 00:45:57,632
All due respect, Maria,
if we dropped charges

628
00:45:57,762 --> 00:46:02,142
every time someone recanted his confession,
our jails would be empty.

629
00:46:02,272 --> 00:46:03,812
We're going to trial.

630
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:07,272
All due respect, Captain,
that's really not up to you.

631
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:11,311
It's up to the DA.

632
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:13,611
I understand your frustration, Maria,

633
00:46:13,731 --> 00:46:16,991
but I reviewed the DA worksheets.
The evidence is compelling.

634
00:46:17,111 --> 00:46:18,991
We'll move forward with the trial as planned.

635
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,961
Fair enough.

636
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:30,171
If that's what you two want, I'm fully behind it.

637
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:33,131
I was really worried about you.
You sure you're all right?

638
00:46:33,251 --> 00:46:36,511
I called your house but I think
the number you gave me didn't work.

639
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:39,681
You wouldn't have reached me anyway,
'cause I was at my girlfriend's.

640
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,720
I spent the night, face-to-face.

641
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,810
Sean, that's very good.

642
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,690
It's all good, Doctor.

643
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,520
I even stopped worrying
about that friend of mine

644
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:55,780
who's been out of touch.

645
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,610
You can't control other people, you know?

646
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,240
This is a real breakthrough.
You should be proud of yourself.

647
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,280
I am proud.

648
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,410
Truth be told,

649
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,879
I never expected to make progress in therapy.

650
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:14,129
That's not true.

651
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:15,549
If that were true,

652
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:19,169
you never would have come
in here in the first place.

653
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,719
What do you want to focus on today?

654
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:24,889
I'm glad you asked that.

655
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:32,939
I'm gonna tell you something

656
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:35,319
that I've never told anyone before.

657
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:37,109
OK.

658
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:41,109
I'm a serial killer.

659
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,498
Oh, God.

660
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:53,878
Oh, that feels so amazing to say out loud.

661
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:57,628
Well, you must be letting go, 'cause
I've never heard you make a joke before.

662
00:47:57,758 --> 00:48:00,048
I'm not joking. I kill people.

663
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:03,338
There it is again.

664
00:48:06,808 --> 00:48:09,178
You should try it.

665
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:10,848
I know.

666
00:48:10,978 --> 00:48:15,517
Your big, bad wolf has racked up
a tidy little death toll.

667
00:48:17,777 --> 00:48:21,317
I'm just kidding. I disabled the cameras,
and I copied the files.

668
00:48:21,447 --> 00:48:23,697
I don't know what you're talking about.

669
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,777
Then focus on your breathing,
and maybe you'll remember.

670
00:48:25,907 --> 00:48:27,327
Meghan, Carolyn, Vanessa.

671
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:31,407
- Those sessions are confidential.
- I'm a control freak, I know.

672
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:32,867
But I watched your home movies.

673
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:36,287
It's amazing stuff.
Drugs, guns, and a crazy psychiatrist.

674
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:39,377
No wonder you're so well versed
in control issues.

675
00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:41,417
You got quite the God complex.

676
00:48:42,677 --> 00:48:44,547
This session's over.

677
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:55,516
Not so fast, Doc.

678
00:49:14,706 --> 00:49:16,706
You're awake.

679
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:19,335
Shall we analyze your dreams?

680
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:23,375
No. That's right.

681
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:26,045
You've already told me
everything I need to know,

682
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:29,885
except why powerful women?

683
00:49:30,005 --> 00:49:33,845
You took powerful women
and made them powerless.

684
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:37,805
They left behind families, children.

685
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:49,564
I have to confess, I'm a little conflicted.

686
00:49:49,694 --> 00:49:52,654
You've helped me make
a major self-discovery.

687
00:49:56,324 --> 00:49:59,324
The fact that I'm a killer...

688
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:15,554
...that's something I can't control.

689
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:25,983
You helped me to accept what I really am.

690
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:27,943
I'm grateful for that.

691
00:50:28,063 --> 00:50:31,233
But...

692
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:35,193
I was raised with a certain set of principles.

693
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:39,493
I'm sorry, Doc.

694
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:42,703
Actions have consequences, and this is yours.

695
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:46,873
I'm gonna have to let you go.

696
00:51:21,032 --> 00:51:24,911
- Hello?
- Is that Eric Carmen?

697
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:30,001
No. What's up?

698
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:32,381
I'm running late.
I'm in the middle of some housework.

699
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:35,211
If I don't get it done,
it's gonna drive me crazy.

700
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:36,711
I never knew you were so anal.

701
00:51:36,841 --> 00:51:38,801
And I'm a neat freak.

702
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:41,431
You're just full of surprises, huh?

703
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:44,391
Oh, you have no idea.

704
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,391
- I'll be there as soon as I can, OK?
- OK.

705
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:14,687
"Barbie. Be patient.
One day we'll share a cold one."
