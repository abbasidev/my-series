1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,920
You still don't remember
anything from before?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,500
Before we took you in?

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,630
No.

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,420
What are you doing?

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,840
I'll talk to you through
a relaxation technique.

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,300
It might bring some things to the surface.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,020
It was a match.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,600
Joe Driscoll was your bio dad.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,690
And this is Rudy.

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,360
- Dexter.
- Hey.

12
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,860
I have waited a long time to meet you.

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,070
Why the different nail polishes?
What's this guy thinking?

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,950
The real king is still out there.

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,410
Hungry.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,830
Ready.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,210
He'll kill again.

18
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,960
It's just a matter of time.

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,380
Dex, Rudy's different.
I feel safe with him. I think...

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm falling for him.

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,050
Divorce papers.

22
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,180
Sign them and I'll agree
to supervised visits twice a week.

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,260
You think you can make me back down?

24
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,220
Are you fucking my wife?

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,940
Kids are settled at Colleen's.
You can visit them when we get back.

26
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,490
I just wish he'd go away. Why can't he
just go away and disappear forever?

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,910
- No.
- Fuck you, whore.

28
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,910
Come on, buckaroos. It's Monday.

29
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,580
Can't be late on Monday.
Throws the whole week off.

30
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,950
What about breakfast?

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,370
Made and eaten.

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,580
- The kids' lunches?
- Packed. Ready to go.

33
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,710
Did you tell the locksmith?

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,710
Yeah, new locks on every door,
reinforced strike plates,

35
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,340
seven-pin keyways.
Here you go, buddy.

36
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,640
Go wait in my car.
I want to talk to your mom for a sec.

37
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,970
- Are you gonna make out?
- None of your business.

38
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,980
- Are you?
- Astor.

39
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,270
You don't have to do this.

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,030
Getting attacked
by your ex-husband merits a day off.

41
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,230
I'm fine.

42
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,490
I won't let Paul control my life anymore.
Those days are over.

43
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,780
It will be OK.

44
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,490
The police have been notified. They'll find him.

45
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,290
What if they don't?

46
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,580
I got you some pepper spray.

47
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,170
Aim for the eyes.

48
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,140
You want some? It's Kirk Bliloc's cake.

49
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,140
I had some at Kirk's birthday. Ten days ago.

50
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,850
Having lunch every day with your boyfriend,
you miss some things around here.

51
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,520
Cake's still good. It's mocha, I think.

52
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,440
It started out vanilla.

53
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,990
Guys, you should look at this.

54
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,490
Put that thing down.

55
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,700
- It was addressed to Homicide.
- Put it down!

56
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,830
Jesus, is that blood?

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,660
Morgan, get your ass over here.

58
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,670
Ass en route.

59
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,750
You're the blood expert. What is this shit?

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,670
It's a little watery for jam.

61
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,670
Maybe you should open it.

62
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,680
What if there's an airborne toxin
in here waiting to be released?

63
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,010
I got to wash my hands.

64
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,430
So gullible.

65
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,480
What is it?

66
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,690
It's definitely blood.

67
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,860
There's something in here.

68
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,670
Marina View hotel.

69
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,670
It's a key.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,880
Maybe a promotional gag.
Stay the weekend, get a jar of blood.

71
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,970
Show-and-tell's over.

72
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,880
Let's try and find out who sent this.

73
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,930
Grab Batista and get over to that hotel.

74
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,010
He's working on the explosion
at the smack lab.

75
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,390
Morgan, put the cake down. You're with me.

76
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,520
A jar of blood. Dramatic, cryptic, playful.

77
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,070
Could it be him?

78
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,830
Got an extra key from the manager.
Said the same thing as the front-desk clerk.

79
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,920
The guy who checked into 103
was white and normal-looking.

80
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,380
I haven't seen a security
camera since we came here.

81
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,170
It's likely he scouted hotels
and chose one with lax security.

82
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,470
Be ready to cancel your lunch.

83
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,340
Police. Open up.

84
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,230
Oh, my God! Jesus.

85
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,150
Get back in your room.

86
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,780
Metro dispatch, this is 3 Henry 88
out of the Marina View hotel.

87
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,400
I need uniformed backup, forensics.

88
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,570
Fuck it. Just send everybody out.

89
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,210
It's been a while
since we went prophylactic.

90
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,800
- Not me. Last night I met this chick...
- I'll stop you there, Vince.

91
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,510
They tell you anything about what's inside?

92
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,300
- No one's been inside. Too much blood.
- Dexter.

93
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,260
Just a heads-up. It's bad in there.

94
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,100
- I'm serious.
- OK.

95
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,770
She's not kidding.
It's your wet dream in there.

96
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,780
You're going in first alone.
Get a sense of what we're dealing with.

97
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,110
Give me a report. Don't fuck up.

98
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,220
Now I'm really curious.
He's been gone so long.

99
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,510
He had to be planning a splashy return.

100
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
But a crime scene just for me?

101
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,530
Mommy!

102
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,010
Tell me you found something.

103
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,840
I talked to the guests in 105.
They didn't see anyone go in or out.

104
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,470
- Across the hall?
- German tourists.

105
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,560
Got their head up their lederhosen.

106
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,970
They heard a whirring sound

107
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,850
but thought someone was mixing
margaritas or vacuuming.

108
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,690
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

109
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm just a little queasy. I fell down in there.
Never should have skipped breakfast.

110
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,370
You're shaking. What happened up there?

111
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,620
No, I'm OK. I just need a little air.

112
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,670
Something finally got to you.
You're human after all.

113
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,710
Cut him some slack, all right?

114
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,500
I hate to disappoint you,
I think it's low blood sugar.

115
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,590
Tell us what you saw, Dex.

116
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,970
- How many dead?
- A lot.

117
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,470
But no bodies, just blood. 50, 60 liters.

118
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,930
Maybe half a dozen dead. I don't know.

119
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,150
There was a mass murder in there,
but they took the bodies?

120
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,570
How is that possible?
There's one elevator, stairs with alarms.

121
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,610
Someone would have seen
corpses coming out.

122
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,700
I don't fucking know.

123
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,870
- Hey, Dexter, you all right?
- I can't go back in there.

124
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,240
You don't have to.

125
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,450
Fine, just get yourself cleaned up

126
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,960
and work from the hallway or something.

127
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,390
You're in room 422.

128
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,390
Elevators are to your right,
and Bobby will see to your bags.

129
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,220
Excuse me.

130
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,650
Dade County, Sheriff's Department.
I'm looking for Rita Bennett.

131
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,520
That's me. Did you find Paul?

132
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,570
I'm sorry?

133
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,940
Paul Bennett.

134
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,320
My ex-husband attacked me last night.
My boyfriend filed a police report.

135
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,700
We only have the report Mr. Bennett filed.

136
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,370
What? Wait.

137
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,080
- Paul filed a police report? For what?
- Assault.

138
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:35,000
Your ex-husband was just released
from Baptist Memorial Hospital.

139
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,840
He's pressing charges against you.

140
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,840
- He attacked me!
- Not according to him.

141
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,350
All right. Can we talk about this later?

142
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,010
We need a formal statement.

143
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,310
You have to come with us
right now to the station.

144
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,480
Fine.

145
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,320
Make sure you label the section of the grid
each blood sample came from.

146
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,690
All right?

147
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,990
Sweet.

148
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,780
You should really get in here, Dex.

149
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,780
I never seen anything like this.

150
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,530
Wait till you see a few more
Columbian drug busts.

151
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,540
I got misting up the walls,

152
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,790
across the ceiling,

153
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,130
but no tissue. Come see.

154
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,920
Photos, Vince.

155
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,760
Why the blood's not clotting?

156
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,430
The blood's not clotting?

157
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,810
Genuine medical mystery.

158
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,310
Just keep getting samples.
I'll test it at the lab.

159
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,990
Hello? Don't hang up.

160
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,410
Dexter, I'm at the Sheriff's station.

161
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,410
Paul's pressing
assault charges against me.

162
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,790
How's it possible? I was defending myself.

163
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,130
Just stay calm. I know a lawyer.

164
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,590
I'll straighten it out.

165
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,420
I am calm. They're the hysterical ones.

166
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,930
They're charging me with
a Class Two felony.

167
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,680
Hello, Dexter? Are you there?

168
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,850
I'm right here.

169
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,480
This is ridiculous.

170
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,230
I could lose my job. I could lose my kids.

171
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,150
I won't let that happen.

172
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,320
- I'm glad you're so confident.
- Rita, just trust me.

173
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,860
I know how the system works.
I'm at a crime scene now,

174
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,740
I have to go.
I'll talk to my lawyer friend right away.

175
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,030
You're OK?

176
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,250
Yeah, I'm OK.

177
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,920
- Thank you.
- Bye.

178
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,680
Is there a wall socket there? Check it out.

179
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,300
- What? A wall socket?
- Yeah.

180
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,260
Of course there's a wall socket.
There's lots of wall...

181
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
You're right.

182
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,100
There was something plugged in here.

183
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,980
Probably a power tool to cut them up.

184
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,020
Come take a look.

185
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,150
Photos, Vince.

186
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,110
Lots and lots of photos.

187
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,990
Open Sesame.

188
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,780
Blood samples for the fridge.

189
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,040
Make room. There's a lot more coming.

190
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,580
Shooters at the Bel Canto tonight. You're in?

191
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,130
I'm not in the mood.

192
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,050
Angel, you're on the market,
and the Bel Canto is hottie central.

193
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,470
Look at this.

194
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,180
They were for Nina's birthday.

195
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,970
- Backstage passes to Neil Diamond.
- You're in worse shape than I thought.

196
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,610
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

197
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,160
Masuka was looking for you.
Something about drinks at the Bel Canto.

198
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,160
I told him I had a yeast infection.

199
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,120
A bit of an overshare.

200
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,920
You want to talk about
what happened today?

201
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,220
Already did.

202
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,050
The last time I saw you
like that was when Dad died.

203
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,430
You can talk to me. You've just
got to open your mouth and move it.

204
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I'll tell Rudy I'll be late.

205
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,310
Deb, seriously.

206
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,270
I puked.

207
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,070
I'm fine. I know you want to help,

208
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,940
but unless you have breath mints,
there's nothing to do.

209
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,820
- Why do you always do this?
- Do what?

210
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,780
You shut me out.
Like your birth father

211
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,950
that lived up the highway your whole life
and never contacted you.

212
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,120
I still don't know how that makes you feel.

213
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,540
If some random emotion strikes me
in the middle of the night,

214
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,710
you'll be the first one I'll call.

215
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,380
Fine.

216
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,630
Whatever.

217
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,560
- Did Paul force his way into the house?
- No.

218
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,890
Did you ask him to leave?

219
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,180
Yes, and he refused.

220
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,980
But in your statement,

221
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,190
it says you invited your
ex-husband into your bedroom.

222
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,940
He was drunk and the kids were asleep,

223
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,150
and I knew exactly where this was heading.

224
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,860
Cracked ribs and a broken jaw.

225
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,950
And you didn't want it to escalate.
I understand that.

226
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,450
But we can't prove intent.

227
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,620
Your ex-husband
has the injuries here, not you.

228
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,540
Paul has a record of spousal abuse.

229
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,170
Spousal abuse can be mutual.

230
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,590
It was never mutual.

231
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,220
But the man is a model parolee.
His drug tests are clean.

232
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,640
He's got glowing reports from
the court-appointed supervisor.

233
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,600
Corrections will want to see
this guy transition.

234
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,890
I don't care.

235
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,440
He's not going near my children.
Do you understand?

236
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,530
Rita, if you deny him visitation,
you could lose your children.

237
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,650
Now, you have deposition in two days.

238
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,910
Do not give him any more
ammunition than he already has.

239
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,670
Damn. Just blood?

240
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,420
What happened to the bodies?

241
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,590
Hell if I know. I don't want to know.

242
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,840
Blood was bad enough.

243
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,010
No wonder you seem so amped.
Your brother must have loved it.

244
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,730
- Fuck no. He freaked.
- Really?

245
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,560
I thought blood was his thing.
What happened?

246
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,650
I don't know. He shut me out like usual.

247
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,070
Did he say anything?

248
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,490
Let's not talk about Dex right now.

249
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,080
Was it like a panic attack?

250
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:44,750
I don't know. He's not really big into sharing his
feelings, in case you hadn't noticed.

251
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,040
Kiss me.

252
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:59,510
What's the matter?
You don't even have wood.

253
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,020
- You're the one who wanted to talk.
- Yeah, but not now. I'm horny.

254
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,190
Maybe I should call him.

255
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,860
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What? We bonded last weekend.

256
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,650
Isn't that what boyfriends
are supposed to do?

257
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,240
Show some interest in the family?

258
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,160
Yeah, but not when his girlfriend's
trying to get into his pants.

259
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,450
Deb, that's not fair.

260
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,040
You take me out on a couples' weekend
to get to know your brother,

261
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,920
and then you punish me for giving a damn?

262
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, your issues don't have to be mine.

263
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,880
You know what?

264
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,390
Forget it. Let's just go to sleep.

265
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,220
OK. I'm gonna go watch TV.

266
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,610
She loved him so goddamn much,

267
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,530
She took every one of his CDs
in the separation.

268
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,740
She wouldn't even give me Greatest Hits.

269
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,410
Nina loved Neil Diamond.

270
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,080
Song Sung Blue.

271
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,580
September Morn.

272
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,750
Oh, my God, Kentucky Woman.

273
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,800
You got to love that shit.

274
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,930
That's like the fourth chick you've driven off.

275
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,480
Waitress! Is there a waitress?

276
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,270
I need a drink. Waitress!

277
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,650
Bro, you're a train wreck.

278
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,650
- You got to stop talking about the divorce.
- I ain't ashamed.

279
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,820
Yeah, I think that's clear, but it's pathetic.

280
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,030
Look, don't talk about
the divorce unless they ask.

281
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,450
Oh, and eighty-six the ring.

282
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,160
I have to take a squirt.

283
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,970
She's gonna fuck me silly.

284
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,350
My sister's right.
I don't share my problems with her

285
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,850
or with anybody.

286
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Harry taught me that.

287
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,560
Secrecy, self-reliance,

288
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,440
and a well-stocked cupboard of Hefty bags.

289
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,650
Fortunately, I've never met
a problem I can't manage.

290
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,660
Until that boy in the blood.

291
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,200
He scares me. I want him to go away.

292
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,960
You awake?

293
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,670
What?

294
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,250
Are you sure you locked the door?

295
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,590
Yeah, I'm positive. Bolt and chain.

296
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,850
What am I gonna do?

297
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,640
Don't worry. I'll figure it out.

298
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
And I will.

299
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,860
I can always see other people's problems
more clearly than my own.

300
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,030
Fortunately, Rita's has a name.

301
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,950
Everyone who set foot on the bloody
carpet in room 103 left a footprint,

302
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,990
and since we do shoe molds
of everyone on personnel,

303
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,250
that leaves only one
set of footprints unaccounted for.

304
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,710
The killer's.

305
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,420
This shows everywhere he went in the room.

306
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,090
The question is why.

307
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,670
Hold on. Aren't we missing something?
Where are the victims' footprints?

308
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,170
Give that lady a lollipop.

309
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,970
Are you suggesting there were
never any bodies in room 103?

310
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,180
Why would a guy stage a massacre
and not have any bodies?

311
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,640
And where'd he get the blood?

312
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,600
I've just got a preliminary blood report.

313
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,270
The blood in that room came from
at least five different bodies.

314
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,520
Possibly more.

315
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,820
My fellow traveler had five victims.

316
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,900
- Ice-truck killer had five victims.
- Five bloodless victims.

317
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,950
I always wondered
what he did with the blood.

318
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,450
Wait. The ice-truck killer
did not horde his victims' blood

319
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,660
just to have a party at the Marina View hotel.

320
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,040
Why would he do that?

321
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,450
To chase me down the rabbit hole.

322
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,410
What was that, Morgan?

323
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,630
I didn't say anything.

324
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,340
I'll remind you people.
We arrested the ice-truck killer.

325
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,670
His name is Neil Perry,
and he's awaiting trial in County.

326
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,680
Bullshit.

327
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,760
Neil Perry recanted his confession.
He's a fraud.

328
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,810
- Try telling that to the Captain.
- I did.

329
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,850
Do we have any more evidence
to support this theory?

330
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,730
When Masuka noticed
the blood wasn't clotting,

331
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:15,770
I ran some tests,

332
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,020
and it was loaded with coumadin and heparin.

333
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,570
One's an anticoagulant.
The other's a preservative.

334
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,150
It means the blood's old.

335
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,070
Plus the blood spatter's all impact and castoff.

336
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,780
There are no hand transfers or swipe patterns

337
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,450
to indicate the presence of any actual victims.

338
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,240
Run the DNA on all five vics

339
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,960
and see if it matches
the ice-truck killer's victims.

340
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,000
You two get out to the Marina View hotel.

341
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,330
Retrace his steps. Maybe it'll tell us something.

342
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,800
And not a word to anyone
about the ice-truck killer.

343
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,810
Astor, just stand up straight.

344
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,350
Do you have
the emergency phone number list?

345
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,730
It's in my backpack.

346
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,100
Do I have to show it to you again?

347
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,980
Just promise me you won't let
your brother out of your sight.

348
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,530
- You're scaring them.
- Well, they should be.

349
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,910
I didn't tell them what Paul did the other night.

350
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,200
What'd you say when you dragged
them to the neighbors'?

351
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,910
I smelled gas.

352
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,080
I should have just thrown them in the car

353
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,750
and headed out of state,
gone back to Michigan.

354
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,460
Remember what the lawyer said.

355
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,510
You don't want to do anything rash.

356
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,510
Just relax. The court supervisor
will be there the whole time.

357
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,690
Hey, buddy. Come on.
Where's the love? Come on.

358
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:41,060
Daddy, what happened?

359
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:44,150
Nothing, buddy. Just a little bump on the head.

360
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,650
We're going to the circus,

361
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,700
'cause Daddy always keeps
his promises, remember?

362
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,030
Good. All right. Ready?

363
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,370
Got your stuff?

364
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,540
Let's go.

365
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,960
You OK? Come on.

366
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,930
I prefer the enchanting Rita
over the worried one.

367
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,720
If I can find a way to make
her ex-husband my problem,

368
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,560
I can help her sleep much easier tonight.

369
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,530
All I need is a little proof
of his inner monster.

370
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,400
Harry would have insisted on that.

371
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,170
Harry didn't believe in preemptive killing,

372
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,380
but maybe I can bend the rules, just this once.

373
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,130
After all, Harry wasn't perfect.

374
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,090
He lied about my birth father.

375
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,680
The trifecta. Weapon, ammo,
and impaired judgment.

376
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,720
Throw in a little domestic violence,

377
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,060
and you have the perfect recipe
for a family slaughter.

378
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,480
Mommy!

379
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,280
Close your eyes, Dexter. Close your eyes.

380
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,370
So, after he soaked the room in blood,
he crossed to the desk

381
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,330
and then over to the bedside table.

382
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,090
There's a clock radio
and some smeared blood.

383
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,970
Maybe he turned it on.

384
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,260
No, we're missing something.
Let's go over it again.

385
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,680
We've been over it three times.

386
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,310
Maybe the map's wrong. Call your brother.

387
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,520
What?

388
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,400
Why is everybody's first move
to call Dexter?

389
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,480
You don't even like him.

390
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,150
What'd the freak do this time,
boil your goldfish?

391
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,780
No, it's just...

392
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,280
It's Rudy. We had our first fight.

393
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,330
Tiff. I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.

394
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,790
I thought we were talking about your brother.

395
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,080
We were.

396
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,210
And we'll be back with
Billy Joel, the Eurythmics

397
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,880
and Devo on 103 FM, hits from the '80s.

398
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,290
Turn that off.

399
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,800
No, wait. I want to hear it.

400
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,760
It's Devo. Turn that shit off.

401
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,340
He said 103 FM. This is room 103.

402
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,350
Leviticus 10:3.

403
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,810
10:3. 103.

404
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,520
Son of a bitch.

405
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,270
You think he's trying
to tell us something?

406
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,940
"I will be sanctified in them
that come nigh me,

407
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,400
"and before all people, I will be glorified."

408
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,870
Hey.

409
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,790
Deb's pissed at me. I need advice.

410
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,960
So you came here?

411
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,970
You know her better than anyone.

412
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,260
Come on. I got two Porterhouses
and a sixer of Microbrew.

413
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,970
Well, one minute we're talking about her day,

414
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,020
you know, the whole bloodbath thing.

415
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,310
Right.

416
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,980
And the next, she wants to jump my bones.

417
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,480
I mean, Deb's hot and all,

418
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,240
but sprinkle in a little conversation
once in a while, you know?

419
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,110
No, she's my sister. I don't know.

420
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,240
Can I help you find something?

421
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:07,120
You wouldn't happen to have
a good meat knife?

422
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,710
Thanks.

423
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,550
Anyway, the other half
of the argument was about you.

424
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,970
Me?

425
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,260
Yeah. It was already tense enough,
but when I brought your name, she lost it.

426
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,180
So, what do I do?

427
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,890
Tell her it's all your fault.

428
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,270
- Seriously?
- You will eventually.

429
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,270
Deb has a way of wearing you down.

430
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,440
Just start from there. It's easier.

431
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,240
I got to take this.

432
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,160
You mind if I...

433
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,790
Where are you?

434
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,590
Still at work, chasing a lead.

435
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,340
Let me guess. The bloodbath case.

436
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,220
I don't want to talk shop right now.

437
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,010
Baby, I am so sorry.
You were totally right.

438
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,260
I was mad at Dexter,
and I took it out on you.

439
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,930
My shift's almost done.
You want to come over and talk?

440
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,400
I'd love to, babe, but I'm about
to eat dinner with Dexter.

441
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,150
Well, after.

442
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,660
Yeah, but here's the thing.

443
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,040
I think I'm gonna sleep at my place tonight.

444
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,210
I mean, it's closer,
and I'm drinking, you know.

445
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,590
You understand, right?

446
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,670
Yeah.

447
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,130
I'll call you tomorrow.

448
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,540
- Care to dance?
- You dance to this?

449
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,130
A bit.

450
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,630
What about your wife?

451
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,670
Tan line on your ring finger.

452
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,090
Well, um...

453
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,640
I'm not gonna talk about that tonight.

454
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,640
Divorced? I get it.

455
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,930
Mine was just finalized.

456
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,070
Let's go.

457
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,950
Will you excuse me? Excuse me.

458
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,000
Police. I need to talk to you.

459
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,170
I'm not a hooker anymore.

460
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,210
I work for a legitimate escort service now.

461
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,710
I'm not here to bust anyone.

462
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,380
I just need to know why
you paint your nails the way you do.

463
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,640
- He was a real good client.
- You want to spend the night in a cell?

464
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,140
All right. About a year ago, there was this guy.

465
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,270
Guy or client?

466
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,560
A john, OK?
That's when I worked Calle Ocho.

467
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,570
Anyway, he started getting all
rough with me until he saw this.

468
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,730
Then what?

469
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,070
Then he changed his tune, got all turned on.

470
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,570
Told me to take my fake hand off.

471
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,700
He started doing some kinky, weird stuff,

472
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,330
like he was worshipping it.

473
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,040
To cap it off, he takes all my nail polish

474
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,750
and paints each nail a different color.

475
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,920
I liked it, so I kept doing it.

476
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,630
You know that guy they arrested
for the ice-truck killings?

477
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,630
Yeah, the one who stuffs roadkill?

478
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,800
- Is that the guy?
- No way.

479
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,390
My trick, he's sexy. A freak, but sexy.

480
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,400
From the beginning and with more detail.

481
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,110
Well, thanks for the hospitality.

482
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,780
Thanks for the steaks.

483
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,780
You know, I didn't get a chance to ask.

484
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,120
Deb mentioned that you had
a little incident at the crime scene.

485
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,410
Did she?

486
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,580
Most of my prosthetic
clients are pretty traumatized

487
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,630
by the time they get to me.

488
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,750
Anyway, I'm a good listener
if you ever want to talk.

489
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,800
Thanks, but unless you know
an expert in repressed memories...

490
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,760
For real?

491
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,270
You know something about it?

492
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,810
More than I ever wanted to.

493
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,140
When I was in high school,

494
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:27,190
I started having these dreams
of a woman hit by a truck.

495
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,940
Who was she?

496
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,240
I didn't know.

497
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,160
Then one day I stopped by a mailbox,

498
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,370
and it all came crashing back.

499
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:49,000
My mom getting out to mail a letter,

500
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,170
me still in the car.

501
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,800
I watched her die.

502
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,980
How old were you?

503
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,230
Four.

504
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,860
I didn't remember anything
till I went and mailed a letter.

505
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,660
Walked right into the belly
of the beast without knowing it.

506
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,330
What kind of memories
are you having?

507
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,090
They're still a little vague.

508
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,380
Right.

509
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,880
Well, you're gonna have to face it eventually.

510
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,760
Maybe next time.

511
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,150
When you see Deb, go with white roses.

512
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:52,360
They're her favorite.

513
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,320
That's a good tip.

514
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,740
It's funny how life brings people together.

515
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,800
Rudy misunderstands my problem.

516
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,970
I want the boy and blood to go away,
not come crashing back.

517
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,640
Fortunately, I have other people's
problems to focus on right now

518
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,770
like forgotten cellphones.

519
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,190
What you got?

520
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,650
So far we're chasing a ghost.

521
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,240
Couple of employees helped with the sketch,

522
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,320
but it's pretty generic.

523
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,450
Only real lead we have is a couple
of numbers at the crime scene.

524
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,450
Screw the numbers. Who was killed?

525
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,790
Where are the bodies?

526
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:48,210
I heard some pretty wild theories out there.

527
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,710
Just theories. We're still
waiting for full blood results.

528
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,290
Damn it, Maria, you're stalling.

529
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,550
I'm just trying to avoid speculation.

530
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,420
You got to give me something and soon.

531
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,550
This department can't afford
another public relations disaster.

532
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:06,140
Well, maybe you should tell
the DA to let Neil Perry go.

533
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,640
He's not the ice-truck killer.

534
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,140
Are you still hung up...
I can't believe this.

535
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,770
Jesus, Maria, that's not gonna happen.

536
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,070
The DA takes his cues from us.

537
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,360
If you just tell him you made a mistake...

538
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,570
Not going to happen.

539
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,580
Now let it go.

540
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,080
First break in this case,
you come straight to me.

541
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,510
This may be a shot in the dark,
but I met this hooker last night.

542
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,010
Going with a pro.
Now, that's how you get over the ex.

543
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,600
No, that's not what I mean.

544
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,060
So you didn't fuck her. But she blew you, right?

545
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,890
Would you shut up?

546
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,270
- It was a lead.
- On what?

547
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,940
I'll let you know if it pans out,

548
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,320
but what do you know
about amputee fetishes?

549
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,530
Oh, yeah.

550
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,740
Yeah. Yeah, it's called acrotomophilia.

551
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,210
But don't let them hear you call it that.
It sounds like a disease.

552
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,040
No, they prefer to be known as devotees.

553
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,210
I knew you were the man to ask.

554
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,300
Not really.

555
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,130
I prefer a girl with a kung fu grip.

556
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,220
You know who you should talk to?

557
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,640
What's-his-face, Deb's boyfriend.

558
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,350
Prosthetics guys deal
with devotees all the time.

559
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,020
Thanks.

560
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,570
No memory flashes here.

561
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,150
No little lost boy in blood.

562
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,530
Maybe he went back to hiding in the dormant
reaches of my cerebral cortex.

563
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,500
Here's to hoping.

564
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,870
Yo, Dex.

565
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,210
So, this is what you do for a living?

566
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,840
I'm trying to match castoff
patterns from a crime scene.

567
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,890
A power tool was used.

568
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,720
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

569
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,980
Circular saw.

570
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,480
Seems like there'd be an easier
way to make a mess like this.

571
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,780
Yeah, trust me. I know.
I've been in here for hours.

572
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,070
In my line of work,
you hear all sorts of horror stories.

573
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,160
Boat propellers, garbage disposals.

574
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,910
It seems like something
you'd see with a chainsaw.

575
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,630
Yeah, I hear that but this power tool
was plugged into a socket.

576
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,920
Guess you haven't heard
of an electric chainsaw.

577
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,880
Come on, people.
We're coming up empty.

578
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,760
Those numbers mean something. 1-0-3.

579
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,350
We need to find the connection,
and until we do,

580
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,480
you need to go over every page
of every police report you wrote

581
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,810
in the last six months.

582
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,860
Think. 1-0-3.

583
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,320
103.

584
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,650
Bus station locker, piece of a bank account,

585
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,780
area code, partial license plate.

586
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,280
What is it? I want answers.

587
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,500
What are you doing here?

588
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,630
How do you always do it?

589
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,670
Do what?

590
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,010
Make me feel like
I'm six years old all the time.

591
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,180
If this is about Rudy, he was
just picking up his cellphone.

592
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,720
Where'd he leave it?

593
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,310
- My apartment.
- What was he doing there?

594
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,400
- Eating steaks.
- And?

595
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,270
I don't know. Drinking beer.

596
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,820
And?

597
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,360
- Debra...
- And?

598
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:50,160
- Talking?
- Talking. You talked.

599
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,070
You opened your mouth,
and sounds came out.

600
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,490
On the same night that I wanted
to talk to you, but you shut me out.

601
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,160
Yeah, "oh."

602
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,590
You don't talk to me, Dex.

603
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,090
You've spent our entire lives
keeping me at a distance.

604
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,600
But my boyfriend shows up
on your doorstep with a couple of T-bones...

605
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
They were Porterhouses.

606
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,020
Porterhouses.

607
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,900
And you end up tossing beers back
into the middle of the night.

608
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,740
You are all the family
that I have, and I barely know you.

609
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,490
So, if you're gonna eat steaks
with somebody after a rough day,

610
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,870
if somebody's gonna break
through your walls, I think it should be me.

611
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,580
I think I have earned it.

612
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,550
I'm late for Rita's deposition.

613
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,310
Deb, it's hard for me. You know that.

614
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,990
You Rudy Cooper?

615
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,000
Angel Batista.
I work with your girlfriend, Debra.

616
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,500
Hi. Nice to meet you.

617
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,420
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

618
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,420
Sure. Let me just grab the door.

619
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,260
So, does this have to do with a case?

620
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:39,890
You could say that.

621
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,480
Well, fire away.

622
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,610
I ran into this lady with a prosthetic hand,

623
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,440
call girl, actually.

624
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,900
Said she had a very unique client,

625
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,740
an amputee devotee.

626
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,330
You have a lead on this client?

627
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,540
That's the bitch of it.

628
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,670
I don't have a goddamned clue,
except for the freaky sex stuff.

629
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,800
I was hoping that you could steer me
toward some of those weirdos.

630
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,380
I'm afraid I got into this business
to help people get better,

631
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,840
not help people get off.

632
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,590
I'm sure Debra will be happy to hear that.

633
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,220
But I can talk to some of my colleagues,
see if I can draw up a list of contacts for you.

634
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,520
That'd be great.

635
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,310
How often does someone get a chance
to help catch a bad guy?

636
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,190
- You in a rush for this information?
- No, no, I'm good.

637
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,070
I'm chasing a long shot, really.

638
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,580
Well, just give me a call at the station

639
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,200
when you got something.

640
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,660
Will do.

641
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,670
Good to meet you.

642
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,840
Good to meet you.

643
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,480
Last question.

644
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,900
According to your ex-husband,

645
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,230
you left town with
your boyfriend last weekend.

646
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,520
That's right. His father died.

647
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,900
Did your ex-husband
have a scheduled visitation

648
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,110
with his children during that time?

649
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,490
I told Paul I'd make it up to him.

650
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,240
So, then he gave you permission?

651
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,580
No.

652
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,250
I'm the one that gave him
visitation in the first place.

653
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,170
I'm the custodial parent.
I didn't have to do that.

654
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,760
Could you give us a second?

655
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,420
Yes, of course.

656
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,850
Why didn't you tell me you broke
your visitation agreement?

657
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,100
I didn't know it was a big deal.

658
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,440
I think she's answered that last question,
so unless there's something else...

659
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,440
No, that's fine.

660
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,860
If I missed anything, we'll get to it

661
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,860
at the psychiatric evaluation next Wednesday.

662
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,610
Nobody told me about
any psychiatric evaluation.

663
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,820
It's mandatory in these cases.

664
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:04,240
The psych test determines
if there's a competency hearing.

665
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,200
For me? But he's the ex-con.

666
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,000
It's standard. You should be fine.

667
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,920
Should be?
You mean she could actually lose this?

668
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,840
Guys,

669
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,090
I'm handcuffed here.

670
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,430
You violated a custody agreement.

671
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,010
You struck your ex-husband in your bedroom.

672
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,270
He has a case.

673
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:37,190
Mama, look at my henna tattoo.

674
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,110
- So, how much candy have you had?
- Lots.

675
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,700
Thanks, now she'll never get to sleep.

676
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:47,080
She'll come down soon.
This one's already crashed.

677
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,290
Mom, can my dad read me a story?

678
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,000
I don't think so, honey.

679
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,000
Please?

680
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,300
OK. Butjust one.

681
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,760
Put your duds on, buddy,
Spider-man ones I bought you.

682
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,800
I'll get him ready.
You've got 20 minutes left.

683
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,930
Thanks, Betty. Thank you.

684
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,560
It doesn't have to be this way.

685
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:17,520
I mean, we can make this easier
on each other, right?

686
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,990
I could drop the charges if you agree
to unsupervised visitation.

687
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,110
Fuck you.

688
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,330
Hey, Dexy.

689
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,170
I don't think your girlfriend
appreciates the gravity of the situation.

690
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,760
If she loses that case,
she could lose the kids.

691
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,470
- That won't happen.
- Never say "won't."

692
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,060
We live in a world of wills,
wills and wonders.

693
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,640
That's what I'm trying
to teach my children.

694
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,150
And they are my children, too,

695
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,900
something she seems to forget.

696
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,860
OK, so I made some mistakes,
but I learned from it, right?

697
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,110
I'm sober.

698
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,620
Look, no needle marks.

699
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,580
I got the Alaskan pipeline
running through these veins,

700
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:16,080
and all because of those two little glowsticks
of love in the next room.

701
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,510
My heart beats for those two kids.

702
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,600
So if you or that skinny bitch
try to screw with what's mine,

703
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,140
I swear to God, I don't care
who I have to hurt...

704
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:44,150
Harry's first rule was,
"Don't get emotionally involved."

705
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,900
I think this is why.

706
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:48,320
Astor, go brush your teeth.

707
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,200
Someone once said

708
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,790
it's easier dealing with other people's
problems than your own.

709
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,290
They were wrong.

710
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,830
- Where were you?
- Taking out the trash.

711
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,250
Did you see Paul?

712
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,380
When I was in the side yard,
I heard the front door open.

713
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,840
My dad's car is gone!

714
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:05,320
Let's face it, Paul. You've been a problem.

715
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,830
It's time for you to go away.

716
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,970
The ice-truck killer case
has been reopened. Officially.

717
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,970
We have new forensic evidence
that shows that the DNA

718
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,720
from the blood at the Marina View hotel

719
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:38,770
matches the DNA from his victims.

720
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,060
What about Neil Perry?

721
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,730
Isn't he supposed to be the ice-truck killer?

722
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,940
All those questions should be
directed to Captain Matthews.

723
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,150
He's been personally handling the Perry case.

724
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,990
Oh, shit. I hope she told the Captain.

725
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:55,580
- Where is he going?
- Thank you so much.

726
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,330
Who knew?

727
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,920
Who knew about this?

728
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,590
This is the first we're hearing about it, Captain.

729
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,750
The ice-truck killer is still at large.

730
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,050
Sure.

731
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,470
I'll call you back.

732
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,600
You overplayed your hand, Maria.

733
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,350
I gave you a chance to make it right.

734
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,610
- I told you...
- You don't tell me shit!

735
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,280
This is my department.
I made you lieutenant. Me.

736
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,240
You were just another spic detective.

737
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,490
Nice, Tom. Real nice.

738
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,120
Your true colors finally come out.

739
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,950
Oh, no.

740
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,330
No, you haven't seen
my true colors, Maria.

741
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,420
But you're about to.

742
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,050
Enjoy this office while it's still yours.

743
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:17,660
What happened? What's wrong?

744
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,500
It's Paul.

745
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,000
I don't know all the details,

746
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,500
but he violated Florida's three strikes law.

747
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,340
The cops picked him up
totally strung out on heroin.

748
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,420
He's back in jail.

749
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,510
It is truly amazing the things you can do
when you put your mind to it.

750
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,720
What's so funny, Mom?

751
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,390
Yeah, why are you laughing?

752
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,060
No problem is insurmountable,
not when you have

753
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,770
the most accessible
evidence locker in Miami.

754
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,190
The equipment that the navy has
is state-of-the-art.

755
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,770
Paul did need to go away.

756
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,860
This is the police.

757
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,030
But death wasn't the answer.

758
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,700
Police. Open up.
We're coming in, Mr. Bennett.

759
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:05,250
Life in prison will do just fine.

760
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,960
They train you to be the best,

761
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,630
and they expect you to be the best.

762
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,960
For now, at least, the code
of Harry remains unbroken.

763
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,470
Get over here. You're part of this family, too.

764
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,610
I need an ambulance at 1228 Caldon Street.

765
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,410
A guy's been stabbed.

766
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,330
Stay with us.

767
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,960
Just breathe, man. Don't try to get up.

768
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,750
Just hang in there, OK? Keep looking at us.

769
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:40,340
Heard they're dropping
murder charges on Perry.

770
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:43,640
Yeah, I'm sure he'll be filing
a lawsuit any minute now.

771
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,560
More shit for us to deal with.

772
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,770
Speaking of which, watch out
for reporters out there.

773
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,690
They're still waiting on
a comment from the Captain.

774
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,940
So, things still rocky at home?

775
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:55,940
With Rudy?

776
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,610
Yeah. I'm not calling until he apologizes.

777
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,490
I'm done being second choice.

778
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,280
Good for you, Morgan.

779
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,240
If you're not doing anything tonight,

780
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,500
Masuka's invited us to the Bel Canto.

781
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,930
- For you.
- It's too late. You blew it.

782
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,180
This is the first chance I've had to talk.

783
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,810
I'm too tired to talk.

784
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,520
Well, let's go home,

785
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:38,900
fall into bed.

786
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,150
Why, Rudy? I mean, fucking why?

787
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,070
You didn't want to fall into bed
the other night

788
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,160
when I laid my heart out on the phone.

789
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,870
- You wanted to talk to my brother.
- I was confused.

790
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,750
I'm not confused. I know what I want.

791
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,580
I was confused because I love you.

792
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:56,040
What I want is very simple
and uncomplicated.

793
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:57,420
What did you say?

794
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:58,670
I love you.

795
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,130
Don't try to...

796
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,850
- Fuck.
- What?

797
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,730
I love you, too.

798
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,110
What happened to your lip?

799
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,910
Incident with a tool at the workshop.

800
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,370
Let's get you home and take care of it.

801
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,110
So, this is doom.

802
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,360
I've been the architect of so much of it.

803
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,070
It's only fair I should know
what the fuss is all about.

804
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,450
He left me this room for a reason.

805
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,920
Five women gave their blood,
their lives for this moment.

806
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:24,050
There's only one way to find out why.

807
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,390
Close your eyes, Dexter.

808
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,100
I want Mama.

809
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,440
No!

810
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,900
No! Not in front of my baby!

811
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,200
Please don't cry. It's gonna be OK.

812
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:56,200
Not in front of my baby!

813
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,500
Don't you dare! Not in front of my baby!

814
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:10,260
Close your eyes, Dexter. Don't look.

815
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,930
Dexter, close your eyes.

816
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,640
I want Mama!

817
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,160
Mommy loves you, Dexter.

818
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,420
Mommy loves you, Dexter.
