1
00:00:02,418 --> 00:00:03,961
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:06,464
I'm so sorry. They got me and Sara.

3
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:10,092
L.J. and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
Are we clear?

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,929
A picture of my son and Sara
to prove they're alive.

5
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:15,306
I'll have a court date,
and you will be there.

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,725
- You're on your own.
- Sofia Lugo.

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,898
- Why does he want this?
- He's just a fisherman.

8
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:26,776
Tell your fisherman friend
Scofield's brother has this.

9
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:30,404
- Just take the bounty off Whistler.
- Whistler don't mean nothing to me.

10
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,740
There are ways I can be of assistance.

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,495
- Whistler's clear?
- Clear as a blue sky, brother.

12
00:00:37,703 --> 00:00:41,290
- So how are we getting out of here?
- I have no idea.

13
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,689
What the hell you doing?

14
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,317
I just...

15
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:54,155
I need some money
and I didn't know where else to go.

16
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,449
- I got about 50 bucks.
- Oh, no.

17
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,952
I'm talking about the millions, papi.
The backpack.

18
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,954
There were all sorts of cash in that.

19
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:05,249
Need a place to crash, got your back,
but the backpack's gone.

20
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,752
I'm gonna need everything else
for my brother.

21
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,130
Remember him? Tall guy. Kind of thin.

22
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,467
- Busted your ass out of jail.
- I feel bad about Mike.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,054
I do, Linc. But not all of us
got exonerated, you know.

24
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:20,097
- Clear on that.
- I can't go home again.

25
00:02:20,264 --> 00:02:24,227
- You got problems, Sucre?
- You ain't the only one, Linc.

26
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:28,064
That's right.
We're all guilty of something, man.

27
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,524
All of us.

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,193
Not them.

29
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,737
I wanna help.

30
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,907
But it seems like it's only getting
deeper and deeper.

31
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,744
Look, I just want the money to get back
on my feet and that's it, Linc.

32
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,872
Linc?

33
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:47,458
Never mind.

34
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,699
Doesn't take too long for man
to become animal, no?

35
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,494
The smart ones go for his bunk first.

36
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,454
And what do the dumb ones do?

37
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:30,293
- I was here first.
- Mampi bitch, you been here two days.

38
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,337
I meant I was the first one to the shoe.
Now, hand it over.

39
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,591
You asking for a chicken foot, friend.
You want this shoe?

40
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:39,093
You're gonna have to come and get it.

41
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,189
Leave him, leave him.

42
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:57,111
I just wanted to express my thanks
for Whistler.

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,822
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're talking about.

44
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,201
My mistake. Anyway, I thought maybe
we could make some arrangement.

45
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:06,078
Maybe I could help out around Sona.

46
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,166
Come here, boy.

47
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,044
Leave.

48
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,344
You help me?
I'm the bucky master here, boy.

49
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,221
Me, not you.

50
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:27,934
So if anyone want anything at Sona,
it's me them a-come to.

51
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,812
So do not walk in asking for some favor
like we have some understanding.

52
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,775
No, no, no. We do not.

53
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,239
Next time you roll in here like that, boy,
the only thing you ask me for is mercy.

54
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,242
See?

55
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,161
Scofield. You have a visitor.

56
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,372
Go on, boy.

57
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,960
Your mama calling you.

58
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,859
That bad, huh?

59
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,486
It's not good. You?

60
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,780
Followed that message
you got from Whistler.

61
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,867
It's all about some book. A bird guide
with names and numbers on it.

62
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,869
Any theories about who he might be?

63
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:30,913
No. We weren't the only ones
following his directions.

64
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,624
His girl was there.
Says he's some kind of fisherman.

65
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,126
Yeah, sure he is.

66
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,046
Listen, man,
I want you to check something out.

67
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,469
Oh, my God.

68
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,599
The way she's holding the paper.
Like she's pointing at something.

69
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:52,476
- It's too small. I can't read it.
- This is today's paper.

70
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:57,273
She's pointing at Santa Rita.
It's a small town 20 miles from here.

71
00:05:57,481 --> 00:06:00,234
She's trying to tell us where she is.

72
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,487
I have to talk to her, Linc.

73
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,574
Even if they let you talk to her, man,
they'd be listening.

74
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:09,410
We're gonna need
more than the name of that town.

75
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,247
I'm coming up empty-handed here,
Linc.

76
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:17,168
It's already been three days
and I got nothing to show for it.

77
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,631
So if I can't break Whistler
out of here...

78
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,718
...you're gonna have to break them
out of there.

79
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,797
So, what's the deal, man?
When's moving day?

80
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,466
I'll tell you the plan
when you tell me who you are.

81
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,427
- I'm a fisherman.
- Really? So am I.

82
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,889
You're worried about trusting me?
My life is in your hands.

83
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,350
How am I supposed to know
that I can trust you?

84
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,394
You don't.

85
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,901
- Boo-yah!
- Hey.

86
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,028
Stuart Scott. Number one, right?

87
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,239
- You watch the SportsCenter?
- Not recently.

88
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,324
Look, I need to get
my hands on a phone.

89
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,536
Heh. I need to get my hands
on some pechos.

90
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,997
But that ain't gonna happen either,
is it?

91
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,874
Who you gotta call so important?

92
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:42,420
- Sara.
- Heh. Absolutely not.

93
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,797
It ain't a request.
It's a dictation of terms.

94
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,843
- My brother ain't thinking about escape.
- Oh, that's sweet.

95
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,514
I can assure you of two things, Lincoln.
One, that Sara's fine.

96
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,934
And two, you have a better chance
of banging me on that bar...

97
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,730
- ...than you do of talking to her.
- I appreciate the offer, but I'll pass.

98
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,774
Yeah? Aw.
What if that's a dictation of terms?

99
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,401
Not a matter of negotiation.

100
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,486
The government
rip out all the phones...

101
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,573
...when they find out bad men in Sona
still setting up deals.

102
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,868
Making bang-bangs like before.
They just did it over the phone.

103
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:18,206
- If they cut the lines, we can fix them.
- There is nothing to fix, bro.

104
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,667
Used to be a whole row of them
along the wall, but they're gone.

105
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,837
If you have no more questions,
I'm just gonna get going.

106
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,673
Michael got the bounty
off Whistler's head in two days.

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,843
That's more than you could do
in two weeks. Show goodwill.

108
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,137
He'll get his goodwill
when Whistler's out.

109
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,641
One thing you should know
about my brother, he's very stubborn.

110
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,560
You want him to fetch,
you throw him a bone.

111
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,980
How does Michael think
he's gonna get a phone inside Sona?

112
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,651
What about cell phones? With all
the traffic moving in and out of here.

113
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,154
Cell phone big no-no.
Only one man has access to one...

114
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,741
...and he would never let
a zanahoria like you get his hands on it.

115
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,993
Let me guess.

116
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,500
What this?

117
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,961
The weekly from your operations
on the outside.

118
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,339
- Gravedigger dropped it off.
- Couldn't be.

119
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,007
This envelope way too thin.

120
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:15,054
Stuff's just moving a little slower
on the outside these days.

121
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,974
Stuff moving slower?

122
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,686
Or somebody making it move slower?

123
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,697
Teodoro.

124
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,201
Set up something
with the barber downstairs for me.

125
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,579
Yes, sir. No problem at all.

126
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,623
You tell that bitch
she nick me with the razor again...

127
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,250
...I'm gonna use it upon her.

128
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,567
You're still alive.

129
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,194
And you're still lovely.

130
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,529
Please.
I haven't showered in three days.

131
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,949
Whatever you smell like,
it's a significant upgrade.

132
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,705
When I didn't hear from you, I--

133
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,999
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,878
- I warned you it might be a bit--
- I know, I know. It's just...

135
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,673
- Every time they dragged out a body--
- Look at me.

136
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,677
I promise you, when I leave this place,
it won't be like that.

137
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,970
Okay.

138
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,557
- Now, were you able to find my book?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:47,605
- But there was this guy, he followed me.
- What guy?

140
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,566
- I don't know.
- Did he hurt you?

141
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,486
No. But he took it.

142
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:57,865
- I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.
- What did he look like?

143
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,743
Shaved head. Kind of big.

144
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:05,748
He said to tell you
that Scofield's brother has it now.

145
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,378
Who's Scofield?

146
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,464
- Who's Scofield?
- Hmm? No one.

147
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,844
He's just someone I'm working with.
He's gonna help me get out of here.

148
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,638
- He's a lawyer?
- Basically.

149
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,394
- Why you want him to have the book?
- Look, the less you know, the safer.

150
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,647
- The less I know, the less help I'll be.
- Exactly.

151
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:33,693
- I just need you to lay low for a while--
- What the hell is going on, James?

152
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,405
- What's so important about this book?
- Nothing.

153
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,658
It just has notes in it, you know.
Phone numbers.

154
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,995
It's people who know people
who are gonna help me get out of here.

155
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,080
You're lying.

156
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,500
Why would I lie to you?

157
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,838
You're the only person in the world
that I can trust.

158
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,425
Come here.

159
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,969
Come here.

160
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,391
- Now, I just need you to trust me.
- And do what?

161
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,186
Nothing.

162
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,552
You looking for something, blanquito?

163
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:47,266
- Yeah. Yeah, I am, I am.
- What you looking for, then?

164
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,018
Something...

165
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,103
A little something to pass the time.

166
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,940
You got paper?

167
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,945
Go down to the Lost and Found
with the rest of them.

168
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,739
- They'll hook you up proper.
- All right.

169
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,908
I find you sniffing around...

170
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:08,788
...you'll find yourself in that ring again,
against me.

171
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,706
I don't like your odds.

172
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,382
Hello?

173
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,136
I want you to check
something out, all right?

174
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,810
Look at her left hand.
It's like she's pointing at something.

175
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,964
You better tell my cousin
he better make himself available.

176
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,383
Better him short money
than me short patience.

177
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,385
Now, comprende, boy?

178
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,933
Need a charge.

179
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:56,229
- Theodore, go and get me laundry, yeah?
- Sure thing, boss. Oh, I almost forgot.

180
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:00,274
I talked to the barber. She's gonna
squeeze you in today around 2.

181
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,693
If that pleases you, patrón.

182
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,404
Patrón.

183
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,123
I think it's time you made good
on all the bad you've done.

184
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,292
You and me,
we're gonna make a deal.

185
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,796
Lechero has a cell phone. I need it.

186
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:26,175
No problem. Shall I turn water
into wine while I'm at it?

187
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,469
Maybe give the guy's mother
a good rogering?

188
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,639
- She'd be a little old for your tastes.
- Careful, pretty.

189
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,433
Don't bite the hand
you're trying to get fed out of.

190
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,227
I'm looking for a favor.

191
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,272
- Why should I do you a favor?
- Unlike your new compadres...

192
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,401
...I know who you are, what you've
done and who you've done it to.

193
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,654
Let me get this straight.
You're saying you're gonna tell on me?

194
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,825
What I'm saying is,
this here is a religious country.

195
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,994
I'm willing to bet the folks
in Panama...

196
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:57,248
...don't take too kindly
to rapists and pedophiles.

197
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,292
You wanna bet against me?

198
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,398
Listen, mate.
Here's what I know so far.

199
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,860
I know you've got a brother
helping outside, ran into my girlfriend.

200
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,905
And I know he took a book from her
that belongs to me.

201
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,408
- I'd like it back.
- What's so special about this book?

202
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,495
Unless it has directions
out of this prison...

203
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,164
...I don't think
it should really matter to you.

204
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,250
You don't know what matters to me.

205
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,544
You'll get that book back
when we get out.

206
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,713
Oh, yeah?
When the hell is that exactly?

207
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,591
I haven't seen bollocks
in the way of breaking out here.

208
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:52,762
Okay, let me tell you
what I know so far.

209
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,681
Some very bad people
who've done some very bad things...

210
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,768
...want you alive
and out of this prison...

211
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,897
...which is why every bone in my body
is telling me to do the opposite.

212
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,357
Then why are you doing it?

213
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,860
You're upset because
someone took a book from you.

214
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,279
This is what they took from me.

215
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,198
So let's be clear.

216
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:19,038
This is what matters to me.
Not you and not your book.

217
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,513
- Hello?
- Cousin, how is it?

218
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,224
Hey, Gusto. You tell me, man.

219
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:43,437
Oh, business is cyclical, Dan Dada.
Ebbs and flows, ebbs and flows.

220
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:49,402
Seems like there's more ebbing
than flowing these days, you think?

221
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,946
Let me tell you what I think, man.

222
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,782
I think a blackguard
is trying to steal my business.

223
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,327
And is taking advantage
of my situation.

224
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,581
If mistakes have been made,
all I need is some honesty, man.

225
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,916
No mistakes, patrón, I swear.

226
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:09,046
Well, maybe the problem
isn't on the outside.

227
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,673
Maybe the problem is...

228
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,136
Augusto? Augusto?

229
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,392
Is the battery dead?

230
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,855
The plug out.
How my phone come unplugged, huh?

231
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,900
My battery dead.
Don't none of you know nothing, huh?

232
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,216
Mr. Mahone. Raul Darinda.

233
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,385
I'm the public defender
appointed to your case.

234
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,014
That's great, that's great.

235
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,808
I've been putting together
some notes that I--

236
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,978
Looks like I have some great news.
We got you a trial date.

237
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:07,980
Heh.

238
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,024
Really?

239
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,984
Thank God, thank God. When?

240
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,530
- June 13th.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

241
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,448
The 13th? That was last week.

242
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,703
- What, we missed it?
- June 13th of next year, Mr. Mahone.

243
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,124
Next year.
How the hell is that great news?

244
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,962
Usually takes two and a half years
for a non-citizen to get before a judge.

245
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,340
I've got a guy in here,
his name is Michael Scofield...

246
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,969
...and he will testify
that he set me up...

247
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,722
...and that he put the drugs
on the boat.

248
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,351
- It will all be taken into consideration--
- A year from now!

249
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,562
I'm gonna have to ask you
to calm down, sir.

250
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,355
Heh-heh-heh.
It's open-and-shut.

251
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,732
It's a no-brainer for you. I got a guy--

252
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,570
The notion of one inmate taking the fall
for another is not exactly fresh.

253
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,948
And usually means someone
was pressured into the confession.

254
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,868
Well, here's the thing, Raul.

255
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:06,122
I require a certain medication
that they...

256
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:10,668
Well, they just don't provide here
and I'm...

257
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,505
Let's just say
that it would be good for everybody...

258
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,551
...if I got this medication.

259
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:24,390
- Is that a threat?
- No, no, it's a reality.

260
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,976
It's called Veratril. And if you--

261
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,854
If you're asking me
to smuggle drugs into this prison--

262
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:33,691
No, I'm not asking you to smuggle.
I'm just saying if you could get them--

263
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,569
- Good luck, Mr. Mahone.
- Please. Wait, you son of a bitch.

264
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,828
Step away from the fence.

265
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,015
Boss, it's almost 2:00.

266
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,727
All right.

267
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,191
You want your cell phone, brother?

268
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,193
No. Just be a half-hour.

269
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,903
Leave it for charge.

270
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:38,256
You got 30--
Make that 26 minutes till he gets back.

271
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,883
If that phone ain't back in the cradle,
we're dead.

272
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,053
Because my Alabama ass
is not going down alone.

273
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,556
- Yeah?
- Tell Sara to call me at this number.

274
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,517
All right. But this Susan
hasn't even agreed to it yet.

275
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,143
What?

276
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,479
I only have 25 minutes
with this phone, Linc.

277
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,941
I'm meeting her right now.
But Santa Rita ain't a one-horse town.

278
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,819
We've gotta hope that Sara
can give us clue as to where--

279
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,573
Just get her on the line, okay?
This is a one-shot deal.

280
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,824
Yeah, I know, man.

281
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:10,288
- Twenty-three minutes.
- I'm nearly there.

282
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:20,548
Hey, looks like we got off
on the wrong foot here.

283
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,763
I'm not a violent guy.
I just need that shoe.

284
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:33,936
I can't hardly walk.
And this place, it changes people.

285
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,106
I never even got your name.

286
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,651
- Pistachio.
- Pistachio?

287
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,237
Now, that's just...

288
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,073
- That's a beautiful name.
- What you want, then?

289
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,911
Well, I was hoping we could make
some kind of a deal. A trade.

290
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,580
The only thing you got to sell,
me no want to buy.

291
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,751
I like me men a little more,
how you say? Not fat.

292
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,085
Fat? This is all muscle.

293
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,923
I'd prove it to you if I didn't think
you'd take things south of the border.

294
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,759
Now, hold on. This is a negotiation.
You don't have to--

295
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:10,556
- I'm not gonna cut you. I got clients.
- Get.

296
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,726
Welcome, patrón.
I'm so honored to have you.

297
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,062
Let's make this quick.

298
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,570
- Where have you been?
- A girl's gotta look her best.

299
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,865
- This isn't a game, sister.
- You better back the hell up.

300
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,492
It's clear that you need us.

301
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,079
Stop pretending you're in charge.
Give us what we want when we want it.

302
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,039
Starting with the damn phone call.

303
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,593
- Hello?
- It's me.

304
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,180
- How are you?
- I'm tired.

305
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,808
- Where are you?
- It's a long story.

306
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,812
As it turns out,
I don't appear to be going anywhere.

307
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,400
I know. I know. I'm working on that.

308
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,403
Listen, Sara,
I miss how we used to talk.

309
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,489
Do you remember
how we used to talk?

310
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,617
- Yes.
- Well, good.

311
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,370
Good, because
I saw your picture today.

312
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:19,917
And I want you to know I understand.
I understand the difficult place you're in.

313
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,921
Michael, listen,
I don't want you to think like that.

314
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:29,886
- Why's that?
- You have to know it's a lost cause.

315
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,806
L.J. and I, we can see it now.

316
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:38,102
It's a lost cause. Do you understand?

317
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,396
No, no, I don't, I don't.

318
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,565
Help me understand.
Help me understand.

319
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:47,111
All I can think of to help
is maybe youijust need more time.

320
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:52,158
It's like they're giving you until midnight
and I'm sitting here at 3 a.m.

321
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,286
They're saying I have to hang up.

322
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,664
- Sara, I love you.
- I love you too.

323
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,626
Sara.

324
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,461
Sara?

325
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,554
Linc, they were never in Santa Rita.

326
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,556
- What?
- She said it was a lost cause.

327
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,767
Said she could see it was a lost cause.

328
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,937
- So?
- Patron saint of lost causes is Saint Rita.

329
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,690
She never told us where they were.
She was telling us what they could see.

330
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,151
He's on his way.
We need to get that phone back.

331
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,569
- One more thing.
- Come on.

332
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,279
Stall them!

333
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,615
Said something about
needing more time.

334
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:35,493
She said it's like
they were giving us until midnight...

335
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,913
- ...but she was sitting at 3 a.m.
- What the hell does that mean?

336
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,958
I don't know, maybe
they're near a clock. That's all I got.

337
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,920
Listen, I gotta go. It's up to you.

338
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,726
Leave him alone, huh?

339
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,080
Lechero.

340
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,584
- There's something you should know.
- What?

341
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:43,811
- I think that barber might've-- Tsk.
- Cut me?

342
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,318
No.

343
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,154
No, my mistake. I didn't...

344
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,116
No, in fact, that there might just be
the best shave I have ever seen.

345
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:02,246
- Well, you look like you need one today.
- I might just do that.

346
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,124
Can't be walking around
looking all bootoo.

347
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,135
Bootoo.

348
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,045
Who is this?

349
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,762
Find out everything you can
about this number.

350
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,559
Yo!

351
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,356
Don't move. I wanna know
what you're doing to James Whistler.

352
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:14,110
I'm doing nothing to James Whistler.
We're on the same team, all right?

353
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:18,406
Take it easy. Just put the knife away.

354
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:22,827
Put the knife away.
Put the knife away.

355
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:27,039
- We're not on the same team.
- You want your boy out of Sona?

356
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,000
- Right?
- Of course.

357
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:32,253
Well, I'm one of the guys
who's gonna break him out.

358
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,548
No, no. I talked to him this morning.
He has a lawyer.

359
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,342
- I don't know what he's told you--
- I know who he is.

360
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,179
Right, a fisherman
that people want out so badly...

361
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,098
...they're willing to kidnap my son
to get him.

362
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,517
Listen, you need to talk to him.

363
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:50,354
You need to talk to him.

364
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:59,655
- Where to, my friend?
- I'm looking for a statue, a monument.

365
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:03,117
- Saint Rita. It says it's in here.
- The Lady of the Lost Causes.

366
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,077
- That's it.
- The red-light district.

367
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,873
- Looking street. You looking to party?
- Yeah.

368
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,345
- You all right?
- What do you want?

369
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:25,139
Let you know
you don't have to watch your back.

370
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:29,894
Make sure I don't have to watch mine.
My head was a free ticket out of here.

371
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:33,856
I don't begrudge anyone who did
what they had to do to try and get it.

372
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,858
Besides...

373
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:42,031
You never know
when you'll need a friend in this place.

374
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,037
Where you from?

375
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:53,709
- Boardman, Ohio.
- Kalbarri.

376
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,504
- Australia. Good fishing.
- You've been?

377
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,673
Passed through.

378
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,218
Small world.

379
00:30:02,385 --> 00:30:04,971
What the hell are you doing
in Panama?

380
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,723
I'm not really in the mood.

381
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:14,355
You're that cop, aren't you?
I was looking at that Scofield.

382
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,149
I was trying to figure
why he looks so bloody familiar.

383
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,820
Hearing your voice, I remember watching
the press when it first happened.

384
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:25,283
- And now you're in it together.
- Small world.

385
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:30,705
You trying to get him out of here?
Extradition or whatever?

386
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,916
I'm not really
in that line of work anymore.

387
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,502
What's he all about, Scofield?

388
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,463
I mean, is he dangerous?

389
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,425
What's it to you?

390
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:45,094
Just curious.

391
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,388
As to what kind of chap
I'm dealing with.

392
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:52,476
I guess that depends
on why you'd be dealing with him.

393
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:55,021
Like I said:

394
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:58,024
- You never know when you'll--
- Need a friend.

395
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,109
Yeah.

396
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:03,404
One thing about Scofield
is that for those that he cares about...

397
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,615
...he'll do just about anything.

398
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:08,534
But he'll screw you
three ways to Sunday if he doesn't.

399
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,120
I can guess which side
you ended up on.

400
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,167
Well...

401
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:23,174
Thanks for the chat.
You know, I really just came by to--

402
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:27,637
You came by because you wanted to find
out more about Scofield but that's cool.

403
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,222
We're squared away.

404
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,778
There. She is there.

405
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:47,114
Is that the only thing
about Saint Rita in this town?

406
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:48,825
That I do not know, my friend.

407
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,846
Excuse me.
Is there a clock around here? A clock?

408
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,561
- Have you seen these people?
- No, señor.

409
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,271
- Huh? No?
- Mm-mm. No.

410
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,944
A clock.

411
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,446
A clock, a clock, a clock.

412
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,372
She said it's like
they were giving us till midnight...

413
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,292
If it's at 12.

414
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:42,461
...and she was sitting at 3 a.m...

415
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:45,047
Three.

416
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,594
Sara.

417
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,114
Dad!

418
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:22,919
L.J.!

419
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,295
L.J.!

420
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:26,964
L.J.! No!

421
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,151
- Hello?
- They made a move.

422
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:49,612
Burrows made a move.

423
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,324
When?

424
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:58,538
It was the right place.
I just couldn't get to it in time.

425
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,832
Did you see them?
Did they look all right?

426
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,667
As far as I could tell, yeah.

427
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:05,670
You can keep that.

428
00:34:05,878 --> 00:34:09,423
Keep it as a souvenir
and give it to Sara when this is all done.

429
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:14,762
Michael, we can do this.

430
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,891
They wouldn't have put you in here
if it wasn't possible to get out.

431
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,518
We can do this.

432
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,187
We can do it.

433
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,258
I think we need to talk.

434
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:56,804
Your friend, the one in the picture.
You say she's the reason you're here?

435
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,265
Then we have something in common.

436
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,101
The woman your brother met
on the outside.

437
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:05,021
Her name is Sofia.
She's the reason I'm here.

438
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:12,361
Well, unless this Sofia's being held
at gunpoint, we got nothing in common.

439
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,032
You can start by telling me
why the company's so interested in you.

440
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,325
What company?

441
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:23,498
I don't have time for games.

442
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:28,711
Okay. Okay, look, look.

443
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:32,548
Been splitting time between here and
the Pacific Northwest running charters.

444
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,217
- Fishing.
- Fishing. Sightseeing.

445
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:36,135
Whatever was paying the bloody rent.

446
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:39,263
A year ago, I took a guy out.
He was some sort of naturalist.

447
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:41,557
He was taking water samples,
measurements.

448
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,601
- What for?
- I don't know.

449
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,811
I didn't care
as long as the check cleared.

450
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,605
Here's the thing, months later...

451
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:50,358
...I get a call,
wanting to know where I took the guy.

452
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,860
And I told them I couldn't remember.

453
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:58,407
But then these government types,
they started showing up at my flat...

454
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:01,327
...asking questions
and I didn't know what to do.

455
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:05,581
So I got low, I came down to Panama
and I moved in with Sofia full-time.

456
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,959
- Until...
- Until the fight in the bar.

457
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:12,421
Yeah. Then I end up here where those
same people show up at visitation...

458
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:14,257
...saying they're gonna get me out.

459
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:17,760
When they do, I'm to take them
to the same place that I took that guy.

460
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:21,055
That's why I need the book
your brother copped. It's my trip log.

461
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,057
I wrote notes.
Coordinates, landmarks.

462
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,810
Retrace my steps and find that.
I don't have a choice.

463
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:29,856
That's an interesting story. But if that
book's as valuable as you say it is...

464
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:33,484
...I should hold on to it. Make sure
they hold up their end of the deal.

465
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:36,529
You don't get this, do you?
I need time to be able to--

466
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:39,991
The only thing I'm responsible for
is getting you out of here.

467
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:44,579
Whatever's between you and them
is between you and them. I'm sorry.

468
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,374
All right.

469
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:51,127
Do you have any idea
how we're gonna do this?

470
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:54,797
All I keep hearing
is how no one gets out of this place.

471
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,175
I think I've heard that one before.

472
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:06,726
Sugar cane so sweet.
The mango so sweet. The women so...

473
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:10,730
Well, if it isn't the entertainer.
How about a joke for us, boy?

474
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:12,190
Not now, fellas. I gotta--

475
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,941
Why don't you do
a little dance for us?

476
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:16,569
How about a little jig?
Maybe you need an extra hand.

477
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:23,701
- You got me.
- That's right. I do get you, boy.

478
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,954
You might've fooled him,
but you have not fooled me.

479
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,344
- Hah!
- Excuse me, boss.

480
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:43,012
I asked you for privacy.

481
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:48,518
I just came here to thank you
for giving me a hand up in here.

482
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:51,979
But if it's all the same,
I'd just like to be relieved of my duties.

483
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:56,818
- What are you talking about?
- There's some loyalty issues going on.

484
00:37:56,984 --> 00:38:00,196
And I do not wanna end up torn...

485
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:03,699
...between my fidelity to you
and having to keep my nose clean.

486
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,953
I've been around to know
that when the dominoes start falling...

487
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,498
...it's the new guy who gets blamed
for bumping the table.

488
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:14,252
- Stop spinning and start talking straight.
- No!

489
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:19,549
- I ain't no rat.
- I'm not asking you to be a rat.

490
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:24,595
I'm asking you to be a friend. Huh?
As I've been with you.

491
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,057
Okay.

492
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:33,813
I was walking earlier
and I heard some voices talking about:

493
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:37,066
"To hell with Lechero. I want my cut."

494
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,236
I couldn't tell who it was...

495
00:38:40,403 --> 00:38:42,738
...but when I got around,
I recognized the faces.

496
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:45,908
The very same faces
I seen in this room.

497
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:48,703
Now, I got nothing to gain here, okay?

498
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,874
I'm a nobody, with no hope
of being anyone. Heh.

499
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:59,130
But those that surround you
have everything to gain if you fall.

500
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:06,137
I hope this makes us even.

501
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:13,394
What I've given you
can't be repaid with one favor.

502
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,356
So I deny your request.

503
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:21,903
You're gonna stay on, as my ears...

504
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:27,325
...to report back to me everything
you hear when I'm not around.

505
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:03,069
- I'm gonna holler at you, all right?
- All right.

506
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:07,698
- How have you been, Michael?
- Better than some, apparently.

507
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:11,494
Hmm. You know, it's interesting
how you don't seem rattled at all...

508
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:13,579
...by our current accommodations.

509
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:16,374
Maybe you're not planning
on being in them much longer?

510
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:20,169
It's like I told you before,
this is the end of the line for both of us.

511
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:23,714
How about this?
You stop me when I'm wrong.

512
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:26,634
The company wanted you here alive,
but framed for murder.

513
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:30,763
For a strange reason you seemed to care
about the fate of this Whistler guy.

514
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:33,766
And I gotta tell you
he's really curious about you too.

515
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:36,477
What talents do you have
that the company decides...

516
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:39,105
...that you are worth more to them
alive than dead?

517
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:41,107
What do you say?
Am I getting warm yet?

518
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:44,026
I think you better pop another pill
because that's crazy.

519
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:46,904
Oh, so you don't mind if I kill him?
Whistler?

520
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:54,412
Question is, would the company mind?
Question is, what would they do to you?

521
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,955
To the ones you love?

522
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,626
Be careful, Alex.

523
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,921
Yeah.

524
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:02,647
- Yeah?
- Busy day?

525
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:04,690
Not as busy as I'd hoped.

526
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,192
Look, you had to try.

527
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,487
I probably would have done
the same thing myself if I were you.

528
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,948
But let's be perfectly clear.

529
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:14,575
You're never gonna try
anything like that again.

530
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:18,371
- I understand.
- Yeah.

531
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,456
Butijust to make sure that you do...

532
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:23,334
...I left you a little something
in the garage.

533
00:42:23,501 --> 00:42:25,169
It's by the trash.
