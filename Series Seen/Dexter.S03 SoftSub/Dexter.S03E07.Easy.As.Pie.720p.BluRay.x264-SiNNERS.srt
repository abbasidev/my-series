1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:03,503
<i>Previously on Dexter.</i>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,505
Remember Camilla
from Records ?

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,257
She's in the hospital. Lung cancer.
It's terminal.

4
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:11,803
Dying I can do.
The pain sure is a bear, though.

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,012
I'll bet.

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:18,226
My whole life, I've been searching
for the perfect Key lime pie.

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,853
How about you start work tomorrow ?
I need an assistant.

8
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,398
Having someone I can trust
is everything.

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:28,528
Barbara Gianna here.
So happens, uh, I'm hungry.

10
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,697
Are you asking me out
on a date, Detective ?

11
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:34,742
- Anton is my contact.
- I know how to work a CI, Quinn.

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,704
Skinner struck again.
The victim's name was Wendell Owens.

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,830
He was 15-years-old.

14
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,791
I can't rule out that I put Wendell
in the crosshairs.

15
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:45,211
He trusted me enough to cooperate,
and look what happened to him.

16
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,672
Hey, look. Don't beat yourself up.

17
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,467
Real reason she's blindfolded
is so she doesn't have to watch everything

18
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,387
she stands for get pissed on
by people like Ellen Wolf.

19
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:58,391
Miguel has been playing fast and
loose with legal ethics for a long time.

20
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:01,728
And you've set the stage for your smear
campaign against a stand-up guy.

21
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,940
You ever wanna hear the unexpurgated
version of your guy, come find me, OK ?

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,109
- We've picked up Ramon Prado.
- For what ?

23
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,070
Kidnapping,
false imprisonment and torture.

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,407
Internal Affairs is investigating you.

25
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,576
- You're finally telling me ?
- I'm finally telling you.

26
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,787
Do you wanna tell me why this IA chick
is so gung ho to bring you down ?

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,539
Yuki and I have a history.

28
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,499
Hola, amigo.

29
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,211
<i>I can honestly say I know
who Miguel Prado really is.</i>

30
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:31,048
<i>My first good friend. And those are
in short supply these days.</i>

31
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,711
Dad ?

32
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,171
You need to throw up... again ?

33
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,513
I'm feeling great, amigo.

34
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:49,437
- How long till you're done in here ?
- Not long.

35
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,022
Great. I'll wait.

36
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:03,659
We'll play a quick nine
when you've finished.

37
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,331
Work on that slice of yours.

38
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,794
Uh.

39
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,714
Nightmare ?

40
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,551
Not sure.

41
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,351
You ever have those dreams
where you're exposed ?

42
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,645
All the time.

43
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,897
I show up at school bottomless.

44
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,317
Body parts out in the open. Exactly.

45
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,613
It's an anxiety dream.

46
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,990
It's probably about the wedding.

47
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,660
That must be it.

48
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,037
It's a stressful time.

49
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,581
But, hey, we got each other, right ?

50
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,628
Mmm.

51
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,630
<i>Except I'm not stressed.</i>

52
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,923
<i>Not about Miguel.</i>

53
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:03,135
<i>He hasn't seen what Harry saw, but so far,
he hasn't turned away from my truth.</i>

54
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,553
<i>He's embraced it.</i>

55
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,183
There's so much to do to pull off this
wedding before the baby starts showing.

56
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,060
I'm good at taking directions.

57
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,021
Good, because I need your guest list.

58
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,318
And your head count so we can pick
a venue and give a budget to the caterer.

59
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,405
Well, there's Deb and, uh...

60
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,077
Deb, that's it. That's my list.

61
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,831
That's it ?

62
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,708
What about your friends ?

63
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,626
Angel, Vince ?

64
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,670
Miguel.

65
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,672
He's a friend.

66
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,674
See, you're on a roll.

67
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,844
Just make sure
you get names, addresses,

68
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,429
spouses and plus ones.

69
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,389
OK.

70
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,807
I gotta go.

71
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,018
They're moving Camilla
to hospice care today.

72
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,769
I wanna stop by before work.

73
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,439
You've been going there a lot.
You holding up OK ?

74
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,898
Yeah, why wouldn't I be ?

75
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:02,319
Well, I know you two were close.
Just give her my best.

76
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,531
Mm-hm.

77
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,910
<i>Those closest to me have always
resided in a box of slides...</i>

78
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,829
<i>until now.</i>

79
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:25,217
Ooh, how about we pop
some wheelies, boys ?

80
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,346
After all, it is the last ride of my life.

81
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,725
You'll be around a long time, Camilla.

82
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,603
Sure as hell better not be.

83
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,483
- You need anything else, just let me know.
- OK.

84
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:48,324
This... This is the room, Dexter.

85
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,286
The room I'm gonna die in.

86
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,623
The sooner the better.

87
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,252
Well, it's nice.

88
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,629
It's got wallpaper.

89
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,591
That shoebox there.

90
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,719
Get it for me, will you ?

91
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:19,146
I thought you might like to have those.

92
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,901
She loved taking pictures.

93
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:29,949
Documented every bridge game
we played with Harry and Doris.

94
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,618
Drove me batty with that camera.

95
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,581
But it's nice seeing these now.

96
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,168
Dexter - The Awkward Years.

97
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,921
And now look at you.

98
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,382
Engaged.

99
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,260
Baby on the way.

100
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,972
I'd love to meet Rita.

101
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,723
We'll make that happen.

102
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,686
And that envelope there.

103
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,606
Those are my funeral plans.

104
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,484
I thought I was organized.

105
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,654
Simple Catholic service. Nothing fancy.

106
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,949
It's all arranged.

107
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,663
What family I have left lives up north.

108
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,499
If you wouldn't mind

109
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:25,004
calling the funeral director
when the time comes.

110
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,464
They'll take care of everything.

111
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,259
Sure, OK.

112
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:31,802
Isn't this a bit...

113
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,972
What, morbid ?

114
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,352
Death will be a mercy, Dexter.

115
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,857
No more pain, no more chemo.

116
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,860
Just... peace.

117
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,654
And the best part ?

118
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:56,243
I'll get to see Gene.

119
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,044
I gotta get to work,
but I'm gonna be back later, OK ?

120
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,629
Don't forget.

121
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:13,886
You promised to find me
the perfect Key lime pie.

122
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,349
Better move fast.

123
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,903
Where can I get a good Key lime pie ?

124
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,322
You can't.
They all taste like sour dog shit.

125
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,740
It's Camilla's favorite.

126
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,909
How's she doing ?

127
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,411
She doesn't have much time left.
You should go visit her.

128
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,247
I don't do sick people.

129
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,915
I can't.

130
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,709
Reminds me too much of Mom.

131
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,715
What's Miguel Prado doing here ?

132
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,553
He is pulling his brother Ramon
out of some deep doody.

133
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,432
We bust him for kidnap and torture
and he's just gonna walk right outta here.

134
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,437
Fucker's lucky he's got
an ADA in the family.

135
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,439
It was an off-the-grid investigation.

136
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,066
Is that what you call false imprisonment ?

137
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,485
I'm not gonna get railroaded
for doing your department's job.

138
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,905
Ramon, if you don't take this offer,
you're looking at jail time here, OK ?

139
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,116
The prick isn't even
pressing charges, Miguel.

140
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:22,204
My detectives will ! Unless they know you're
not walking around with a badge and a gun.

141
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,749
What, I give you my shield and then what ?
What the hell am I supposed to do ?

142
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,251
Get some help !

143
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,089
Hermano... you don't have
a lot of options here, OK ?

144
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:37,177
It's early retirement with benefits.
Union won't be able to do better.

145
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,971
Listen to your PBA rep, will you ?

146
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,223
And keep the Prado name
out of the papers, right ?

147
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,687
You really wanna put Sara
and the kids through all that ?

148
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,330
I'll deliver these to his captain,
start the paperwork.

149
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,750
- Appreciate the consideration, Lieutenant.
- Yeah, OK.

150
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,675
This really would have been bad for me.

151
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,806
On top of the Ellen Wolf accusations,
the Chicky Hines case...

152
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,101
Chicky Hines wasn't personal, Miguel.

153
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,189
Yeah.

154
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,067
Helping Ramon, that was personal.

155
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,318
Thank you.

156
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,331
- Tense in there.
- A lot tenser in here.

157
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,167
I gotta blow off some steam.

158
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,088
After work, you and me,
we're gonna go hit something...

159
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,172
hard.

160
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,716
- We are ?
- At the driving range.

161
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,803
Golf, right.
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

162
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,104
So, what, you and the ADA,
you're pals now ?

163
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,732
Yeah, we are.

164
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,692
Kiss-ass.

165
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,446
<i>Another crack like that
and you're off the list.</i>

166
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,742
<i>Family and friends...</i>

167
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,620
<i>I see these people every day,
but if they really knew me,</i>

168
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,705
<i>they'd hardly call me friend.</i>

169
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,833
<i>Miguel might be the exception.</i>

170
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,421
So when I say the Skinner is a top priority,
I expect progress.

171
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,047
Understood ?

172
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,049
Now where are we
on the national database ?

173
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:42,553
- We ran it. Nothing came back.
- Got a call into Interpol too.

174
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,471
<i>Should I invite Quinn ?</i>

175
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,266
<i>He's so... tan.</i>

176
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:50,060
First, someone loaned
Freebo some money

177
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,563
and is willing to skin people
to get it back.

178
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,442
That same someone is drafting off
our investigation. We are being watched.

179
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,278
Which is why I wanna use
our CI more aggressively.

180
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,446
You mean Anton ?

181
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,449
Yeah, we're gonna spread the word
that Anton knows where Freebo is.

182
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,908
You're gonna use him as bait ?

183
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,370
Ramos, Soderquist, I wanna put Anton
under surveillance immediately.

184
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,082
<i>That's his name. Soderquist.</i>

185
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,376
You're gonna tell him, right ?

186
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,378
All due respect, Sarge,
we tell him, he bolts.

187
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,672
Two of my witnesses have turned up dead.
You wanna see a third ?

188
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,467
Anton's already got
a target on his back by helping us.

189
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,635
- This will protect him.
- Yeah, right.

190
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,806
OK, look. I'm gonna keep Anton
in the dark for now.

191
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,101
But I want eyes on him at all times.
Understand ?

192
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,564
- Hey, Deb ?
- What ?

193
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,441
Are you gonna bring
a date to the wedding ?

194
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:41,069
I don't know, Dex. I might be too busy
picking up pieces of Anton's skin

195
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,821
to even be there.

196
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,490
So you're a "maybe" ?

197
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,326
Morgan. Her.

198
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,787
Wendell Owens's mom called. Sounds like
she has something on his murder. I'll drive.

199
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,247
Do not invite Quinn.

200
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,499
No Quinn.

201
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,542
Yo, Morgan.

202
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,587
Him. Grab your kit, buddy.
We got a crime scene.

203
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,008
Ah !

204
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,636
Fucking mess.

205
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,016
City pays for the tree trimming
but not the cleanup.

206
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,810
We all can't live in high-class
neighborhoods, Morgan.

207
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,147
Yeah, I'm sure you live
in a real dump, Mr. Cadillac.

208
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,904
Ms. Owens, I understand you have some
new information about your son's murder ?

209
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,657
Yes, I do. I found this.

210
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,331
That's my card.

211
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,542
It was in Wendell's shorts.

212
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,170
The ones he was wearing that night.

213
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,297
The ones he got killed in.

214
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,967
- I am so sorry for your loss.
- You stay the hell away from me !

215
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,094
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

216
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,222
- I didn't mean to...
- You didn't mean to what ?

217
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,601
You came to my house.
You talked to my son and I told you not to !

218
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,020
You gotta go back inside.

219
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:07,030
You led that animal here.
Right here to my only baby.

220
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,078
And now he's gone.

221
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,999
Wendell is gone because of you !

222
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,250
He's gone !

223
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:32,347
<i>Marriage, children.
You never expect it to end in tragedy.</i>

224
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,559
<i>Unless you're me.</i>

225
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:41,106
I want all civilians cleared off the street.
We're gonna be rolling out a body.

226
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:45,319
Lisa Morton. College valedictorian
on her way to Harvard Business School.

227
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,114
Found the murder weapon.
Under the sofa.

228
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,241
Screwdriver's consistent
with the wound.

229
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,535
The perp must have used it
to jimmy the front window.

230
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,747
I figure the girl heard it,
came down to check it out,

231
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,625
took a swing at the perp,
missed, knocked over the lamp.

232
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,919
The perp freaked, stabbed her, ran.

233
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,632
Apparently without shoes.
These are sock prints.

234
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,426
- Socks ?
- Yeah, looks like he cut himself.

235
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,970
Or stepped on the victim's blood.

236
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:16,141
No, if it was hers the prints would become
less saturated as he ran away

237
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,352
and got back to the window.

238
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,104
But they're more saturated, see ?

239
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,023
Blood belongs to our guy.

240
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,650
Fucking socks.

241
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,819
Run it through the criminal database,
see if anything gets kicked back.

242
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:32,115
I'll bet you a night of lap dances
I already know who did it.

243
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,909
Albert Chung.

244
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:38,538
Got arrested six months ago on a B&E.
Knocked an old lady down some stairs...

245
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,875
and he did it all in his socks.

246
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,878
Same old lady, identifies
the wrong guy in the line-up,

247
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,088
shoeless schmo walked.

248
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,049
How do you remember that ?
It wasn't even a homicide.

249
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,426
Chung is Asian, bro.
He makes us all look bad.

250
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,389
And taking off his shoes ?
Can anyone get more cliché ?

251
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:59,935
Well, he probably did it to keep quiet
or to not leave shoeprints.

252
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,729
So he leaves sock prints.

253
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,314
Frickin' moron.

254
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,192
And Asians are supposed to be smart.

255
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,655
Fuckin' Albert Chung.

256
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,866
Fucking Albert Chung.

257
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,953
Fucking Albert Chung.

258
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,748
First, an old lady,
now a college valedictorian.

259
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,334
Well, we've matched his DNA
to the blood at the crime scene.

260
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,796
Mug shots on every media outlet.
Someone will turn him in.

261
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,383
First I got Ramon
drinking himself into a stupor,

262
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,720
then I got Syl nagging me for attention,

263
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,472
and I got scumbags like
Albert Chung running free.

264
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,474
Well, the department's working
on that last one.

265
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,019
And what if they do catch him, eh ?
Then what ?

266
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,230
His attorney got him off once.

267
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,357
I'll lay you odds
that Chung walks again.

268
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,193
¡ Coño !

269
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,238
No. You and I...

270
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,074
we should take
care of this ourselves.

271
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,911
There's a lot of wrong in the world, Dex.
Just ask Lisa Morton's parents.

272
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,080
Argh.

273
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,040
Slice.

274
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:09,129
I guess it can't hurt to keep tabs on Chung
if the police can't bring him in on their own.

275
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,924
Hell, let them have Albert Chung.
He's just the symptom.

276
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,262
We need to go after the root cause. The one
responsible for putting him on the streets.

277
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,432
His blood-sucking, soulless,
defense attorney...

278
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,017
Ellen Wolf !

279
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,482
She... got her client off.
Isn't that her job ?

280
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,776
Her job is to uphold the law.

281
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:34,404
But Ellen Wolf, she twists and bends
the law until it's unrecognizable.

282
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,948
Has she, uh...

283
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,618
ever actually killed anyone ?

284
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,954
Chung wasn't the first evil fuck
that she put back on the streets.

285
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,165
The body count is piling up !

286
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,376
If she hasn't done the deed
with her own hands...

287
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:52,088
- Dexter, you're being too literal.
- I don't think I am.

288
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:54,341
Do me a favor, OK ?

289
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,510
Keep an open mind about her.

290
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,972
Let me show you some files.
No pressure. Just research.

291
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,269
Move your back foot to the left.

292
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,691
Excellent !

293
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,193
Yes.

294
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,447
<i>Ellen Wolf doesn't fit my usual code,</i>

295
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,660
<i>but in the interest of friendship
I said I'd keep an open mind.</i>

296
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:25,622
<i>Camilla's request for the perfect
Key lime pie is much less complicated.</i>

297
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,417
I'm not eating this crap.
Get it out of here ! Get it out of my room !

298
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,921
All right, honey, it's gone.
Don't you worry.

299
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,841
She's having a hard day.

300
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,051
Got some news.

301
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,147
Bad news, huh ?

302
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,191
Tumors worse ?

303
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,318
No.

304
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,281
It's slowing, Goddamn it.

305
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,450
Doctors gave me another month.

306
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:07,789
Another month of struggling to breathe,

307
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,709
of shitting myself,

308
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:15,714
of this stupid fucking wallpaper.

309
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,175
I'm... I'm sorry.

310
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,429
I already lived through this with Gene.

311
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,140
The end-stage.

312
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,769
All I want is to be
on the other side of it.

313
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,273
He at least had me.

314
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,442
And you have me.

315
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,821
I'll bring you as many Key lime pies
as you can stand.

316
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,243
Gene wanted me
to end his life, you know ?

317
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,542
I would have done it if I could have.

318
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,087
It's kind of illegal.

319
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,715
It's more than illegal.

320
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,718
It's a mortal sin to us Catholics.

321
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,680
One-way ticket to hell.

322
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,979
I can't take my own life either.

323
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,900
But...

324
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,447
you're not Catholic.

325
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,491
No.

326
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,952
I'm definitely not Catholic.

327
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:32,457
But I do live by a certain code.

328
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,584
Of course you do.

329
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,422
Harry... taught you right.

330
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,220
So what I'm about to ask you is...

331
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,141
the most terrible thing anyone could...

332
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,559
Camilla, I don't...

333
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,104
Just... help me.

334
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,774
Please.

335
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,612
You're strong.

336
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,408
And a good friend.

337
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:11,830
No, don't...
don't answer now.

338
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,500
Just think about it.

339
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:39,232
<i>She couldn't have asked a better person.
Taking lives is what I do.</i>

340
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,737
<i>But never someone innocent,
and certainly not a friend.</i>

341
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,346
Get in.

342
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,521
What's so important you had to see me
at the ass-crack of dawn ?

343
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,232
Do you have any out-of-town relatives ?

344
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,735
Why, you wanna take
a vacation together ?

345
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,074
OK.

346
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,242
What's going on ?

347
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,661
Uh...

348
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,541
I heard a rumor about you.

349
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,586
That you know where Freebo is.

350
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,254
You know that I don't.

351
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,673
I'm just telling you what I heard.

352
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,468
And the other cops heard it too.

353
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,599
Which means that the Skinner
will be looking for me.

354
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,435
Shit. This shit is crazy.

355
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,313
I've got nothing to do with Freebo
except for helping you,

356
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,566
and no one knows about that
except for the cops.

357
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,029
Wait, are you telling me...

358
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,656
Am I being set up ?

359
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,287
Jesus. And here you are
asking me about out-of-town relatives.

360
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,289
- Everybody's got one.
- So you want me to go ?

361
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,083
I want you to survive.

362
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,840
I don't wanna lose a good CI, you know.

363
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,345
Listen, you telling me...
me leaving...

364
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,140
it's not gonna help you any.

365
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,392
I'll find another lead.

366
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:41,312
- So I guess I should go.
- Good.

367
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,110
You watch that mouth of yours.

368
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,530
Fuck you.

369
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,007
<i>The code has always been my guide.
Why should this be different ?</i>

370
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,801
<i>Taking an innocent life
could be a dangerous precedent.</i>

371
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,804
<i>I can't just change the rules for a friend.</i>

372
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,474
<i>Or maybe I don't want to.</i>

373
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,814
<i>But I can honor Miguel's request
to research Ellen Wolf.</i>

374
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,983
<i>Keep an open mind.</i>

375
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,694
<i>Murderers, rapists, carjackers</i>

376
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,322
<i>set free to commit
more heinous crimes.</i>

377
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:36,993
<i>Maybe my code could include the person
who unleashed them on the world.</i>

378
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,211
Hey, you.

379
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,879
Hey, did you get my messages ?

380
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:52,175
- The list. You need my list.
- ASAP.

381
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,012
Working on it right now.

382
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,181
Thank you, Dexter.

383
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,230
We still don't have a head count,
so I can't start looking for a venue.

384
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,357
It'll all get done, I promise.

385
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:11,319
Just made an appointment with the florist.
We can drive by after Carapan.

386
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,239
I'd be having a complete meltdown
if it wasn't for you, Syl.

387
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,866
Believe me, I'm happy for the distraction.

388
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,077
From what ? You have such a charmed life.

389
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,496
On the outside, in front of company.

390
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,998
But Miguel, when we're alone he's...

391
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,708
Syl, what ?

392
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,336
He just...

393
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,214
He goes to this dark place.

394
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:35,176
I know he lost his brother and now
his other brother's in trouble, but...

395
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:38,721
- That would put a strain on anybody.
- But he's being secretive. He's never home.

396
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,392
He says he's with Dexter, but...
I think it's a cover.

397
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,312
Are you sure you're not reading into it ?

398
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,066
I went through the same thing with Dexter.
He was disappearing, acting weird.

399
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,360
What happened ?

400
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,779
He was...

401
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,115
He...

402
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,908
He was...

403
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,244
going through a difficult time.

404
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,912
Rita, tell me.

405
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,756
He was doing drugs
and he was having an affair.

406
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,466
Dexter ?

407
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,970
God. If someone like Dexter can do that...

408
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,723
Look, we hadn't defined
our relationship yet.

409
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,850
It wasn't like you guys. It was different.

410
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,269
But the important thing
is that I confronted him,

411
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,063
we talked about it, and it actually
brought us closer together.

412
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,733
You just confronted him ?

413
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:36,738
Well, I mean, if you don't deal with your
problems they only get bigger, right ?

414
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,741
Dexter ? Really ?

415
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,869
I know, I know.

416
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,497
There's no way your nickname
was worse than "Fatista".

417
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,041
Cause "Gianna" just rolls off the...

418
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,001
"Vagianna".

419
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,255
OK, you win. Kids can be cruel.

420
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,549
"Fatista", huh ?

421
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,094
You can call me whatever you want.

422
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,430
Ah, too soon.

423
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,557
It's OK. I'm very patient.

424
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,642
Actually, Angel, I...

425
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,854
I think you're great, but...

426
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,398
"But". I hate that word.

427
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,734
I like spending time with you.

428
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,570
It's all right. You can say it.

429
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,490
You want us to be just friends.

430
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,708
I... I like our friendship.
You gonna make me feel bad for that ?

431
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,794
No. I like it too.

432
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,295
But you want more.

433
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,672
You gonna make me feel bad for that ?

434
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,932
- You rang ?
- Ellen.

435
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,059
I didn't expect you to come over.

436
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,685
I didn't expect you to call.

437
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,316
So ?

438
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,364
I'm starting to think
I'm too close to the Prado family.

439
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,743
I know one side of them.
Maybe there's more.

440
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,705
- There is.
- Such as ?

441
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,582
Broad strokes ?

442
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:15,169
Uh, missing evidence,
witness intimidation, jury tampering.

443
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,131
I've got details.
You wanna hear 'em ?

444
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,593
- You have proof ?
- He's a bad guy. He's not a stupid guy.

445
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,554
Mmm.

446
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,934
He couldn't have changed that much.

447
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,019
Hmm, maybe he didn't.

448
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,941
My ex-husband was always a prick.
I just didn't wanna see it.

449
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:41,487
It's a little hard
to take in, you know ?

450
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,657
It's about to get much harder.
That's actually why I came in person.

451
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,034
Miguel's on his way over here right now.

452
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,620
What ? Why ?

453
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,623
To negotiate the terms
of Albert Chung's surrender.

454
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,042
You're not representing Albert Chung.

455
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:59,338
Chung saw himself on TV and called me.
I'm here as his counsel.

456
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,592
You call Miguel Prado a bad guy
while representing someone like that ?

457
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,053
- It's not my job to judge, Maria.
- Well, you're certainly judging Miguel.

458
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,098
And if he ever gets arrested,
I will defend him too.

459
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,229
Fucking Albert Chung.

460
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,983
That dipshit's photo has gotten more
primetime play than any Asian face in years.

461
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,610
Way to represent.

462
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,738
It also got over 600 tipsters calling in.
Folks up in arms over this one.

463
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,323
Hey, guys ?

464
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,285
I need your addresses for the wedding,
and I need to know if you're bringing dates.

465
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,579
Can we bring "just friends" ?

466
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,539
I never bring dates to a wedding.

467
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,458
Best man always hooks up
with the maid of honor.

468
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,502
The maid of honor is Rita's daughter.
She's ten.

469
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,170
Masuka's your best man ?

470
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,088
- I, uh, hadn't really...
- Why ?

471
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,799
- Are you asking Batista ?
- Cause I'd be honored, hermano.

472
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:46,052
Um, uh, I don't...

473
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,514
I'm not having a best man.

474
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,309
Well, what about ushers ?

475
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,819
I need back copies of your reports
on the Skinner cases.

476
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,614
All of them.

477
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,867
- You looking for anything in particular ?
- Something, anything.

478
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,578
I need a fucking lead, Dex.
I'll be here all night if I have to.

479
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,040
- Diligent.
- Not really.

480
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:19,835
Did you ever...

481
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:26,634
you know, compromise an investigation
for personal reasons ?

482
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,264
- Never.
- Figures.

483
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,227
- Where did you get these ?
- Camilla.

484
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,856
She's in a lot of pain.

485
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,652
Then I hope she goes fast.

486
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,571
Not likely.

487
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,077
Just shoot me if I ever get like that.

488
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:55,830
- Really ?
- Hell, yes.

489
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,082
I'd do the same for you.

490
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,669
Pull the plug, put a pillow
over your head, whatever.

491
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,130
I'd never let you suffer.

492
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,966
You wouldn't, would you ?

493
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,012
Dexter. Will you bring the prelim blood
report on Lisa Morton to the briefing room ?

494
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,430
Miguel Prado's asking for it.

495
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,600
- He's here ?
- He and Ellen Wolf.

496
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:19,353
To negotiate the terms
of Albert Chung's surrender.

497
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,980
Wear your flak jacket.

498
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,944
I'm not interested in your terms, Counselor.
Albert Chung needs to turn himself in.

499
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,197
If you want Albert Chung
I suggest you get interested, Counselor.

500
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:33,534
Preliminary blood report as requested.

501
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,786
I'd actually like Dexter to stay.

502
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,039
Ms. Wolf might need a forensics expert

503
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,083
to explain to her how hopeless
her case really is.

504
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,294
Oh, please, do stay.

505
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:44,962
Dexter.

506
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:49,008
<i>He wants me to see how bad
Ellen Wolf really is.</i>

507
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,427
<i>This is me, open-minded.</i>

508
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,722
Go ahead with your terms, Counselor.

509
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,141
My client requests the news media
be present

510
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,185
and that he be allowed to make a statement.

511
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,646
He requests the charge
be kicked down to manslaughter.

512
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,397
You've gotta be kidding.

513
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,026
He also requests conjugal visitation.

514
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,403
Jesus, you have no shame !

515
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,324
And no case ! Run the evidence
from the crime scene, will you ?

516
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,451
Blood at the scene belonged
to Albert Chung.

517
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,704
DNA matched his sample in our database.
Odds are 170 million to one

518
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,666
that it's anyone but Albert Chung.

519
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,126
Mmm, it won't hold up.

520
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,171
You do know what odds are ?

521
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:31,676
The jury won't. Not when I get done
discrediting you and your chain of custody.

522
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:36,138
I think we all know how easy it is
to plant evidence and, well...

523
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,682
you look the type.

524
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:41,352
Do I see sheets of plastic
in your future ?

525
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,979
Dexter's work is solid, Ellen.

526
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,440
Your prosecutor isn't.

527
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,443
Walk in the park
to discredit you, Counselor.

528
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,696
Try it. We're gonna add slander
to aiding and abetting.

529
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,656
- I'm not the one on trial.
- Oh, you should be.

530
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,534
You should be ! Getting your brother off
with a slap on the wrist !

531
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,536
Not to mention the Chicky Hines debacle.

532
00:33:58,662 --> 00:33:59,870
All right, let's stay on point here.

533
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,707
If Albert Chung kills again
while you pursue this bullshit,

534
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,208
that blood is gonna be on your hands,

535
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,293
- or do you even care ?
- Like you do ?!

536
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,463
You spout off about justice
and the Constitution,

537
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,217
except for that pesky part about
everyone deserving a fair trial.

538
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,345
While you set free the scum of the earth
for a fast buck, right ?

539
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,557
How many pro bonos
do you take on, Miguel ?

540
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:24,061
Huh ? How many innocent people have you
saved from fascistic prosecutors...

541
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,896
- Ellen.
- Don't kid yourself.

542
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,399
You might as well be walking the street
the way you make a living.

543
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,526
OK, enough, enough !

544
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,991
Dexter, would you step outside, please ?

545
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,159
Yeah.

546
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:44,665
Miguel, you know that
that was completely out of line.

547
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:49,628
<i>I'm no fan of Ellen Wolf's, but all I see
is a defense attorney doing her job.</i>

548
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,213
<i>Maybe too well.</i>

549
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,215
<i>But I can't kill her for that.</i>

550
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,010
<i>Now I have to tell Miguel no.</i>

551
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,554
<i>Not what he wants to hear.</i>

552
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,641
You're going the wrong way, Morgan.

553
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,895
I'm just grabbing dinner, Sarge. I'm gonna
do some overtime on the Skinner case.

554
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,772
What do you hear from Anton ?

555
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,316
He's not answering his calls
but I think he probably...

556
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,527
Yeah, that's good.
OK, see you. Gianna ?

557
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,324
- Hey, just heading out.
- Yeah, um...

558
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,785
a buddy of mine is getting married
in a few weeks,

559
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:23,412
and he asked me
if I was gonna bring a date,

560
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,956
and you're the only one
I wanted to invite.

561
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,292
You're inviting me to a wedding ?

562
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,920
Maybe you don't get the concept of friends.

563
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:34,215
It's not a date. It's... It's a plus one.

564
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,718
The wedding
is besides the point.

565
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,514
It made me realize that you're the one
I wanna spend time with.

566
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,976
And if us being friends
means I get to keep doing that, I'm in.

567
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,814
This isn't some kind
of weird end run is it ?

568
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,816
Make me see how sensitive
you really are ?

569
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,610
- I'm not all that sensitive.
- Yeah, you are.

570
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,449
I'm confused. I'm...

571
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,789
<i>Hand-holding.
So simple. So intimate.</i>

572
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,125
<i>So... uncomfortable.</i>

573
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,337
Sorry about the pie.

574
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,798
I was told it was the best.
It got five stars.

575
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,216
Don't worry about it.

576
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:23,722
Until you find me the perfect Key lime pie,
I have something to live for.

577
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:33,482
Dexter, I'm so sorry for putting you
in that horrible position.

578
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:41,240
Asking you to violate your conscience
was one of the worst things I've ever done.

579
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,742
I want to you help you, Camilla.

580
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,538
If I were someone else, I'd do it.

581
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,665
I know.

582
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:56,171
I should have thought about your past
before I asked.

583
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,010
My past ?

584
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,471
I know your secret, Dexter.

585
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,727
You think...

586
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,188
if you help me die...

587
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,733
you'll be like him.

588
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,321
Your brother.

589
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,032
Brian Moser.

590
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,367
The Ice Truck Killer.

591
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,579
I don't have a brother.

592
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,540
You did.

593
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,377
I read your file before I destroyed it.

594
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,590
Your birth mother was Laura Moser.

595
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:46,764
When the newspaper said Brian Moser
was the Ice Truck Killer...

596
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,934
I made the connection.

597
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,896
- Camilla...
- It's all right, Dexter.

598
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,152
I'll take it to my grave.

599
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:08,369
And you could never be like him.

600
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,342
I had a high opinion of you, Deb.

601
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,512
Guess I was wrong.

602
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,682
I told you repeatedly to stay out of my shit,
and you wouldn't.

603
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,768
So you told Quinn
I was investigating him,

604
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,562
he did what he does
and now the case is dead.

605
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,398
You chose the wrong friend.

606
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,484
Hey, you're the one who fucked him.
Not my fault he didn't want an encore.

607
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:44,655
- Is that what he told you this was about ?
- He didn't have to. It was obvious.

608
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,075
Little Miss Heartbreak
turns a Cadillac and a fancy watch

609
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,703
into a fucking IA investigation.

610
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,204
How is that even original ?

611
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:57,418
What an empty room your world must be
if those are the dots you connected.

612
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,670
I'm happily married.

613
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,589
Seven years.
Working on our second kid.

614
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,759
With zero interest in a waste of clothes
like Quinn.

615
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,886
Fine.

616
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,680
I really don't give a shit.

617
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,307
Well, then give a shit about this.

618
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:15,060
A cop's dead
cause Quinn cut all of the wrong corners.

619
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,855
I came to you for help
to get him out of circulation.

620
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,441
You refused.

621
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,818
Next dead cop's on you.

622
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,121
<i>A dinner party.
Washing dishes. It seems so mundane.</i>

623
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,457
<i>But it's oddly... soothing.</i>

624
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,876
<i>Maybe this is what
belonging feels like.</i>

625
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,295
Keep this up,
we're looking at dishpan hands.

626
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,798
I should add rubber gloves
to our gift registry for Dexter.

627
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,259
- We can do that ?
- Oh, you can register for anything.

628
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,928
Furniture, motorcycles, power tools.

629
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,680
Power tools.

630
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,390
Ah, Jesus, Sylvia !

631
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,643
Come on, use your brains, baby !
We just got this thing re-stained !

632
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,730
- I got it. It's fine.
- Yeah.

633
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:04,860
Uh, why don't Syl and I finish the dishes
and we'll put dessert in the oven ?

634
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,154
And you guys pop a movie in for the kids.

635
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,573
Uh, yeah, sounds good.

636
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,909
- Movie time, kids.
- Come on, muchachos.

637
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,536
Uncle Miguel's
gonna put a movie on for you.

638
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,250
Sorry about that.

639
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,587
He probably invited you guys over
so he wouldn't have to be alone with me.

640
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:28,342
- Things haven't gotten any better ?
- Worse. After I confronted him.

641
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:29,927
Oh, no.

642
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,764
He just completely shut down. Now
he can't even be civil in front of company.

643
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,725
I'm so sorry.
I never should have said anything.

644
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,311
No. It's not your fault.

645
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,689
Maybe Dexter's a bad influence on him ?

646
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,360
I know. Wishful thinking.

647
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,904
He'd be a problem I could actually fix.

648
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:57,955
<i>He's going to bring up Ellen Wolf,
and I have to tell him no.</i>

649
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,873
<i>Can friends do that ?</i>

650
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,917
So, uh, Ellen Wolf.

651
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,378
Piece of work, right ?

652
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,840
Go easy. Be tactful.

653
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,925
We can't kill her.

654
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,844
I see.

655
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,888
She's... just doing her job.

656
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,393
You should tell that to the parents of all
of those people that her clients have killed.

657
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,894
Yeah, I read about them.

658
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,231
I also read about the wrongly convicted
people she got off death row.

659
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,316
The defense fund she set up.

660
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:30,028
She's fucking with the system.
Eating away at it from the inside out.

661
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,406
Control, Dexter.
That's what she likes.

662
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,033
And now she's trying to control me.

663
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:39,663
Re-opening my cases.
Undermining years of all my hard work.

664
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,540
So... this is personal.

665
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,083
Fuck yes, this is personal.

666
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:47,421
And it should be personal for you too. As my
friend, I'm asking you to do this for me.

667
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:50,132
- I'm sorry, no.
- Well, then fuck you !

668
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,927
She's fucking with my life !

669
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,601
I'm gonna go.

670
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,688
<i>I've never been great
at conflict resolution.</i>

671
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,859
<i>Not without a blade
and several rolls of plastic wrap.</i>

672
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:11,528
Did Dexter and Miguel
have a fight ?

673
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,989
No, sweetie. Did you ?

674
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:18,994
Uh, why don't you guys
go get ready for bed ?

675
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,332
So what happened ?

676
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,042
You grabbed us outta there so fast

677
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,879
and you've been grinding your teeth
the whole way home.

678
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:32,090
- I disagreed with him.
- About the affair ?

679
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,801
- What affair ?
- Syl thinks there's someone else.

680
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:36,720
Oh.

681
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:39,723
He's definitely obsessed with someone,
but there's no affair.

682
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,226
And there's not going to be one either.

683
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:45,270
- What ?
- I'm confusing my metaphor.

684
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,606
Well, friends fight sometimes.

685
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,196
I'm not sure he'd consider me
much of a friend right now.

686
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,031
Hey, you're a great friend.

687
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,618
The problem's his.

688
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,914
Well, either way, life was good before him.

689
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,166
It'll be good after.

690
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,585
It's all right to be upset.

691
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,755
I'm not upset.

692
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:26,103
Yo, Dex.

693
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,981
Put me down for a plus one
to the wedding.

694
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,899
The list. Right.

695
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,277
Hey, that's a plus one.

696
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:34,653
OK.

697
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,280
- Sarge.
- Yeah ?

698
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,574
I think Morgan needs an intervention.
She's been here all night.

699
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,326
- She find anything ?
- I don't know.

700
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,079
She's waiting on you for the big reveal.

701
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:51,336
<i>Batista may be plus one,
but after last night, I'm minus Miguel.</i>

702
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,506
<i>But with or without my help,
Camilla's on her way out.</i>

703
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,467
<i>It's OK. I'm better off on my own.</i>

704
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,763
I can't believe this jackass
is still on the run.

705
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,894
You know, he kinda looks like you.

706
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,314
That... That...

707
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,317
That's called racism, buddy,
so don't even...

708
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,360
Oh, shit.

709
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,113
He does look like me.

710
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,126
I found a fucking lead
on the Skinner case.

711
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:33,253
In the trees, right ?

712
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,297
We've had our heads up
our asses, Sarge.

713
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:39,676
We've been looking down at the bodies
but no one has been looking up.

714
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:44,097
How much caffeine have you had ?

715
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,682
A metric fuck-ton.

716
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,851
You should stop.
It's giving you Tourette's.

717
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:51,146
Our second victim, right ?
Javier Garza.

718
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,191
I'm looking through it, and I remember
talking to this George guy.

719
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,485
This tree-trimmer,
George something.

720
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,405
It reminds me of that fucking mess
at Lorna Owen's house, right ?

721
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,117
Where somebody had trimmed the trees
and they didn't bother to clean it up.

722
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,454
So I'm thinking,
"Trimmed trees. Tree-trimmer. "

723
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,206
Maybe there's a connection ?

724
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,374
OK.

725
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:16,088
So I go through every fucking photo
of every fucking crime scene,

726
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,423
- and guess what I found ?
- Trimmed trees ?

727
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,718
No, I didn't find shit.

728
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:26,056
But when I looked
at the homes of the victims...

729
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,225
motherfucking trimmed trees.

730
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,853
The Skinner is using tree-trimming
as a cover for surveillance.

731
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,232
He watches from the trees
and when the time is right he grabs them.

732
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,236
Tree-trimmers, landscapers...
blends right in.

733
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:46,785
Check city maintenance schedules.
Get sub-contractors' names.

734
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:50,539
Anyone who's worked near any of
the victims' homes. Let's bring 'em in.

735
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,501
I still can't get a hold of Anton.
I think he might have skipped town.

736
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:57,546
Then it's a good thing
you found a new lead. Huh, Morgan ?

737
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,715
Good work.

738
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,307
Anton skips town. You find a new lead.

739
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,643
Pretty convenient.

740
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,770
Up all fucking night.

741
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,480
Nothing convenient about it.

742
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,649
Not all of us cut corners, Detective.

743
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,791
- You haven't been answering the phone.
- I've been busy.

744
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:37,127
I can see that.

745
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,882
- I can also see that you're troubled.
- Yeah.

746
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,676
That conscience I don't have ?
It's been eating away at me.

747
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,182
I know. I'll turn my client in.
Then I'll feel better.

748
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,350
You're only half-joking.

749
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:55,979
You wanna bring in Albert Chung
as badly as we do.

750
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:58,940
I'm here to help.

751
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,609
You can't.

752
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,487
I can... if you let me.

753
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,656
If I let you I'll be violating privilege.

754
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,992
Well, that's where
the help part comes in.

755
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,955
See, I'm getting to know you
and that granite set of ethics you've got.

756
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:16,750
Couldn't crack 'em even if I wanted to.

757
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,211
You know that about me, huh ?

758
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,921
Yep.

759
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,009
But it's your job to make sure Albert Chung
has his day in court.

760
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,846
And it's my job to make sure that happens.

761
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,890
I've got several ways of doing that.

762
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:36,978
For instance, sometimes I set up
surveillance outside his attorney's office.

763
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,650
Only an idiot would ask
for a meeting here.

764
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,944
Only an idiot.

765
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,660
I am not good at this.
Letting people help me.

766
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,870
I know that about you too.

767
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:57,916
Why do you think I brought the Scotch ?

768
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:02,879
Deb, Angel plus one, Vince,
Maria LaGuerta...

769
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,590
Doughnut guy ?

770
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,509
I see him every day.

771
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,303
If you don't know his name,
he's not invited.

772
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:21,106
We can come back.

773
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,277
Dexter, bring that girl of yours in here.

774
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,571
I'm here. I'm right here.

775
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,949
Hi. It's so nice to finally meet you.

776
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:33,994
Oh, Rita.

777
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,454
You know, I've got it.

778
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,977
Hey, you came.

779
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,021
You called.

780
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,649
- What the fuck are you doing here ?
- I live here.

781
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,818
Not here.

782
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,530
Here. We thought you left.
We pulled your security detail.

783
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:14,492
I have two dead-bolts
and a nosy neighbor. I think I'm safe.

784
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,912
Well, you'd be a lot safer in Chicago.

785
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:21,124
I didn't wanna go
without talking to you first.

786
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,836
I wanted to say thanks, you know,
for giving me the heads-up.

787
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:30,508
I do get free long-distance.
You could have called me from Chicago.

788
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,802
I didn't wanna go to Chicago, Debra.

789
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,520
I know what you did for me.

790
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,608
And I know what it could cost you.

791
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,988
And I know how badly
you want your shield.

792
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:57,577
Not if it means using you as bait.

793
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,586
But I'll do it.

794
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,382
For you.

795
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,595
I'll be your bait.

796
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,663
Thanks for coming.

797
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:44,749
You hear about Albert Chung ?

798
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,376
Who hasn't ?

799
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,546
You hear how they got him ?

800
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,548
No.

801
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,886
He showed up at Ellen Wolf's
office for a meeting.

802
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:02,475
Cops got wind of it. Sent SWAT in.
They did the whole shock-and-awe thing.

803
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:09,816
Apparently Ellen Wolf was in on it.
She helped get him into custody.

804
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:12,902
You were right about her, Dex.

805
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:19,075
I told you when we first met,
I usually don't take no for an answer.

806
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,412
That's kind of a button with you, isn't it ?

807
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,376
It couldn't have been easy for you.
But a good friend, a real friend...

808
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,754
does the hard thing.

809
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,966
I was out of control. I was letting
personal shit cloud up my thinking.

810
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,719
And you, you reigned me in.

811
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,637
And, uh...

812
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,057
Well, hey, friends fight, right ?

813
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,311
I guess so.

814
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,897
They also apologize when they're wrong.

815
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,900
I was wrong.

816
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,110
I apologize.

817
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,616
We're not gonna man-hug, are we ?

818
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:06,331
- How about a beer ?
- Yeah, I'll get it.

819
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,834
Uh, two bottles.

820
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,128
<i>Am I really a good friend ?</i>

821
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,884
Thanks.

822
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,638
<i>Miguel thinks so. Rita... Camilla.</i>

823
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,726
<i>I wouldn't know. I don't have a lot
of experience in that area.</i>

824
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,063
To Ellen Wolf.

825
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,864
<i>Maybe with practice.</i>

826
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,991
Hey, you wanna be my best man ?

827
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,210
<i>Miguel says a friend does the hard thing.</i>

828
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,755
<i>I agree.</i>

829
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:40,967
<i>And I'm about to become
a true friend to Camilla.</i>

830
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,514
<i>My secret ingredient.
Sodium pentothal.</i>

831
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,725
<i>Coma in half a minute.</i>

832
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:53,104
<i>Pancuronium stops
her breathing and then...</i>

833
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,148
<i>peace.</i>

834
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,191
<i>For her, anyway.</i>

835
00:54:05,826 --> 00:54:07,327
Dexter.

836
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,871
I have a gift for you.

837
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,582
It'll make you feel better.

838
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:21,883
Thank you.

839
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,940
Are you sure ?

840
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:39,150
I'm sure.

841
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,250
You finally brought me...

842
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,130
the perfect pie.

843
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,581
I'll tell Gene...

844
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,882
you say hello.

845
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,556
<i>I'm doing a good thing, aren't I ?</i>

846
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,641
<i>Then why does it feel so...</i>

847
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,144
<i>bad ?</i>

848
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:01,024
I want you to know
that you were right...

849
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,360
about my brother.

850
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:07,530
But there's something else.

851
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,618
I killed him.

852
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,624
It's good...

853
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,379
...you did.

854
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:40,646
<i>All the lives I've taken,
they've always begged for mercy.</i>

855
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,901
<i>I've never understood
that concept until now.</i>

856
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,029
<i>This.</i>

857
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,073
<i>This is mercy.</i>

858
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,243
<i>But only for a friend.</i>
