1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,211
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,046
God, you're on fire.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,258
- Oh, shit.
- What ?

4
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:11,427
I'm pregnant.

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:16,808
I just got word Angel will be
Detective Sergeant Batista.

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:20,436
Fred Bowman, AKA Freebo,
kills two college girls

7
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,480
and escapes on a state police screw-up.

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,273
Looking to hold some product.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,983
I need a hit.

10
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,277
Did you hear what I said ?
Fuck off, Teegan.

11
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,113
Fine, your dick
can suck itself from now on !

12
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,660
Freebo, get back here !

13
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,834
- Who are you ?
- Who are you ?

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,460
- I got it, Dex.
- Got what ?

15
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,214
Only the case that's gonna get me
my shield. It's huge. Angel put me on it.

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,216
Who he is is what makes
this case huge.

17
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,886
It's Miguel Prado,
Assistant District Attorney.

18
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,138
He and LaGuerta go way back.

19
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,641
The other guy's Ramon Prado,
Miguel's middle brother.

20
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,435
He's a lieutenant
with the sheriff's department.

21
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,811
And...

22
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,688
- Oscar.
- Prado ?

23
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,314
As in baby brother.

24
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,525
<i>I've never killed anyone
I didn't completely vet before,</i>

25
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,361
<i>whose guilt I wasn't
absolutely certain of.</i>

26
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,448
<i>Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo.
Then he tried to kill me.</i>

27
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>He's gotta be guilty of something.</i>

28
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,077
Why would a blood spatter analyst

29
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,289
spend time searching for information
on my dead brother ?

30
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,875
This death got to me.

31
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,085
- Morgan, right ?
- Do I know you ?

32
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,837
Yuki Amado, Internal Affairs.

33
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,173
- And ?
- You know Joey Quinn ?

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,341
I'm gonna do you a favor. Call this guy,

35
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,594
tell him you wanna cash in
one of my coupons.

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,888
He's an informant
from my days in Narcotics.

37
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,390
- You're Anton ?
- You got something you need to show me ?

38
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,518
- What about this Prado guy ?
- Oh, yeah, I've seen him before.

39
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:46,105
Oscar Prado was into Freebo
for some serious cash.

40
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,024
You getting along with the new boss man ?

41
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,110
Ah, fuck him. He took me off
the Oscar Prado case and put me on this.

42
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,904
Some dead-end Jane Doe.

43
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,990
<i>Teegan. Freebo's girlfriend.</i>

44
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,242
<i>Looks like he's still in Miami.</i>

45
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,279
<i>We're supposed to see hope in children.</i>

46
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,617
<i>But right now, all I see are
little bundles of uncertainty.</i>

47
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,160
<i>And germs.</i>

48
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,494
<i>But that's another matter.</i>

49
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,330
<i>I love kids.</i>

50
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,332
<i>I can play with them, enjoy them...</i>

51
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,208
<i>and leave.</i>

52
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:15,838
<i>I don't have to worry
about what they'll become.</i>

53
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,426
<i>A Nobel Prize laureate.</i>

54
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,220
<i>A drunk.</i>

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,350
<i>President of the United States.</i>

56
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,144
<i>Or someone like me.</i>

57
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:34,523
<i>Why do parents take the chance ?
I've never felt compelled.</i>

58
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,945
<i>But why would I ?
I'm not in the business of giving life.</i>

59
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,332
It's for sure. I'm pregnant, heh.

60
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,049
What should we do ?

61
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,095
I don't know.

62
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:20,152
We should talk.
Weigh all the options.

63
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,029
Together.

64
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,200
I have to get to work.

65
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,288
<i>Weighing options.
The pros and cons.</i>

66
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,916
<i>Something I'm good at, usually.</i>

67
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:42,091
What the fuck, Dex ? I was yelling at you
to hold the elevator, asswipe.

68
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:45,011
Sorry, I'm feeling off.

69
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,221
So see a doctor.

70
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,182
Saw one. Really didn't help.

71
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,978
The Oscar Prado case ?

72
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,938
Yeah, fuckers are on
the career-maker of the year.

73
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,941
They nail this Freebo guy
and they're golden.

74
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,278
The courts already let Freebo go once
for those two girls in the Everglades.

75
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:05,865
That was then. This time he killed
a senior ADA's brother.

76
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,617
Caffeine fix.

77
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:11,037
<i>Except he didn't kill Oscar.</i>

78
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,538
<i>I did.</i>

79
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,915
<i>If it hadn't been for Freebo,
Oscar would still be alive,</i>

80
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,500
<i>and I wouldn't be in this mess.</i>

81
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,003
<i>Besides, he's seen my face.</i>

82
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,756
<i>I've gotta find Freebo before they do.</i>

83
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,508
<i>That's one thing I'm sure of, at least.</i>

84
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,261
Nice watch. Knockoff ?

85
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,180
Me ? No. Real thing only.

86
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:33,100
I sold a kidney to get it.
I'll show you the scar sometime.

87
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,518
I'll give you a kidney not to.

88
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:39,815
Hey, Dex, do me a favor. Go over the
Prado blood evidence one more time, OK ?

89
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,108
Maybe you missed something.

90
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,485
- OK, but...
- Sarge !

91
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,986
- Yeah ?
- We got Narcotics on the line.

92
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,447
All right.

93
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,241
- Hey, Dex, wait up.
- Oh.

94
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,748
My Jane Doe. See what you see.

95
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,125
Already saw what I saw,
which was nothing.

96
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,919
So see what you see again.

97
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:03,506
I can't afford an unsolved,
and I've got fuck-all on this.

98
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:07,176
Coroner says he found a pharmacy in her.
Big surprise, right ?

99
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:09,637
Body dumped near
the waterfront stroll. Shocker.

100
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,347
She looks like every other
tweaker hooker case.

101
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:16,435
- Except the tattoo peeled off her shoulder.
- Coroner says not a tattoo.

102
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,189
You're getting interested.

103
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,399
Actually, I'm getting sleepy.

104
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,747
<i>It's reassuring to know
I'm not the only one at sea.</i>

105
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,835
<i>I could throw them a line,
tell them their cases are linked.</i>

106
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,421
<i>That Jane Doe was actually
Freebo's girlfriend.</i>

107
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,218
<i>That it was Freebo who killed her.</i>

108
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,012
<i>But I need the head start.</i>

109
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,145
Step away from the incense.

110
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,067
This is America, buddy.
Freedom of religion.

111
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,488
I didn't realize you were a Buddhist, Vince.
Japanese are traditionally Shinto.

112
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,408
Are we ? Oh, whatever.

113
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,161
I bought all this shit
off my manicurist.

114
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,914
Need all the luck I can get.
Got a crucifix up there too.

115
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,709
Cause it did so much for Jesus ?

116
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,588
Cause Forensics Quarterly is deciding
whether or not to publish my article.

117
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,300
You know, the one you read.
And proofed.

118
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,218
The incense stays.

119
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,310
Coulda used you at the doctor's office.

120
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:47,109
But you've got to use me, Maria.
ADAs can put pressure on other agencies.

121
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,737
We have Ramon, who's with the sheriff's
department. Together, we...

122
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:55,034
Miguel, Miguel, tranquilo. I know that
you and Ramon are going to help.

123
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,204
And it's hard to let somebody else
handle Oscar's case.

124
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,623
But I have my best detectives on this.

125
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,333
I got the best forensics team...

126
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,335
- Morgan, right ?
- He's part of it.

127
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,755
We are tracking down every one of Freebo's
known associates,

128
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,298
looking under every rock.

129
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,134
We will find him.
This is a good team.

130
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,096
This is the same team, by the way, that
shared a roof with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

131
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:22,436
That was totally out of line.
I'm... I'm sorry, Maria.

132
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:31,362
It's just that my...
my fuse is so short ever since Oscar.

133
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,367
Even with Syl. I'm driving her nuts.

134
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,162
I doubt that.

135
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,748
She knows what she's got.

136
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,218
The Bay Harbor Butcher situation...

137
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,470
- No, don't...
- No, please.

138
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:04,520
I was too personally involved
to see it clearly.

139
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,983
And that's why I've distanced
myself from things.

140
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,780
You should do the same with Oscar.

141
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,912
I know.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,459
I know. You're right.

143
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,006
Some things never change.

144
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:41,390
We're not as close as we used to be.

145
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,851
But at least I still have you
as a colleague.

146
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,356
And I'm glad that it's you that's here.

147
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,650
- Hmm ?
- Gracias.

148
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:05,331
Miguel Prado's already seen too much
of me. I can't comfort the grieving.

149
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,504
- You got this ?
- I got this.

150
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,724
Don't look familiar, hon.

151
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,602
Ooh, but those are
some fine streaks.

152
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,520
Who did her hair ?

153
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,939
Christophe of Beverly fuckin' Hills.

154
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,650
Yeah, do you have his number ?

155
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,904
Petunia, you are the dumbest whore
on this stroll.

156
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,698
Sorry, sugar. Don't got a name for you.

157
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,200
Keep walkin', girl.

158
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,827
It's all you're good for.

159
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,455
S'up, Deb ?

160
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,957
The she-males give you any leads ?

161
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,876
It's Officer Morgan to you.

162
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,961
Right, not a detective yet.

163
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,256
Course, an unsolved isn't gonna get you
any closer to a shield.

164
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,550
Look, I don't know why IA picked me, but...

165
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,886
Cause Detective Quinn likes the ladies.

166
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,889
Well, then you don't need a snitch.
You need a fuckin' slut.

167
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,809
So why don't you go talk
to Petunia over there ?

168
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,811
I can get you a shield tomorrow.

169
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,314
I'm a sergeant, after all.

170
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,983
You'd give me a shield for being a rat ?

171
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,529
No, for being an honest cop, Debra.

172
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,614
Like your father.

173
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,368
You are not goddamn
digging into my father right now.

174
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,664
Digging ? Please. The old-timers at IA
talk about him like he's a brother.

175
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,459
The old-timers also talk about
how popular that made him.

176
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,671
Oh, God.
That really matters to you, doesn't it ?

177
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,923
Your cop friends.

178
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,218
It's your whole life.
Them, the job, the shield.

179
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:46,181
Far as I can tell, without that,
you've got nothing.

180
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:50,352
Except your, uh, treadmill.

181
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,650
Kind of a cunt, aren't you ?

182
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,028
Nice.

183
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,825
But seriously, um, you should look into
expanding your world a little.

184
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:09,538
You know, finding something else fulfilling.
Like gardening or, um...

185
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,291
ooh, scrapbooking.

186
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,084
Just in case.

187
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,180
<i>Get me a name.</i>

188
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,140
<i>Teegan.</i>

189
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,393
<i>Drove a Volkswagen Rabbit.</i>

190
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,563
<i>That should buy me an address for her.</i>

191
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,399
<i>If I'm lucky,
she left me a lead to Freebo.</i>

192
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,736
<i>Tee... gun.</i>

193
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,363
<i>How many parents would give
their kid a name like that ?</i>

194
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,867
<i>Four.</i>

195
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,953
<i>Nope. Nope.</i>

196
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,497
<i>Bingo.</i>

197
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,207
<i>Teegan Campbell.</i>

198
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,918
<i>Address on Sorority Row.</i>

199
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,086
<i>Guess I know what I'm doing tonight.</i>

200
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,880
<i>Teegan...</i>

201
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,800
<i>No, not a name I'd choose.</i>

202
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,930
<i>Megan. Mary.
Those are classics.</i>

203
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,224
<i>Or, for a boy, Charles...</i>

204
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:15,604
<i>or Philip.</i>

205
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,231
<i>Or Richard.</i>

206
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,945
<i>Or what's so bad about...</i>

207
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,155
<i>Dexter, Jr ?</i>

208
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,789
<i>Reminds me of you, Dex.</i>

209
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,673
<i>Harry. The last person I'd turn to
for advice on fatherhood.</i>

210
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,424
<i>Old habits die hard.</i>

211
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,052
<i>Gotta focus on something easier to kill.</i>

212
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,303
<i>Freebo.</i>

213
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,557
Dexter ! Momentico.

214
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:55,811
<i>Shit. Sorry, I'd rather go rifle
through a dead girl's apartment.</i>

215
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,312
Dexter.

216
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,982
We, uh...

217
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,986
I never really got to thank you for, uh,
coming to Oscar's wake.

218
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,740
It really means a lot to me and my family,
knowing that you...

219
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,826
are taking a personal interest
in the case.

220
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,328
OK. Well, you're welcome.

221
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,913
Uh, what are you doing tonight ?

222
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,833
- Nothing.
- Oh, well, then, you'll come for dinner.

223
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,504
I rarely take no for an answer.
You're gonna learn that about me.

224
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,589
I will.

225
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,383
Honestly, uh... I wanna pick your brain
about something.

226
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,094
And Syl and I, uh,

227
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,513
you know, we could...
we could use the company.

228
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,558
The more people around,
the less we think about, you know.

229
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,102
- Sure.
- You married ? You got kids ?

230
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,187
No. No kids. Uh, girlfriend.

231
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,940
Ah, bueno, bueno. Bring her.

232
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,317
Unless you were lying.

233
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,237
You know,
about doing nothing tonight.

234
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,575
We're gonna towel off,
and we'll be right back.

235
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,165
Officer Morgan, a music lover.

236
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,294
You ever seen this woman ?

237
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,129
Did Quinn send you ?

238
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,215
Different case.

239
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,218
- My debt's to Quinn.
- Your debt's with the department.

240
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,473
I'm not an information ATM.

241
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,185
I'm fucking desperate ! All right ?

242
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,939
I got a steaming heap of crap
all on this case.

243
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,401
I've gone through every scum-sucking
ball sack of a pimp I know,

244
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,905
every whacked-out hooker.
You are my last-ditch ass-fucked effort !

245
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,077
Goddamn, you got
a mouth on you, woman.

246
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,038
Great, thank you.

247
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,959
That's cool. Show me the picture.

248
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,464
Not from the neighborhood.

249
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,175
But from the looks of her,
I doubt she had to pay cash for her habit.

250
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,430
A strawberry ? Right. So I'm looking
for a dealer who'll take payment in sex.

251
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,682
Yeah. That'll be about all of 'em.

252
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,434
Yeah.

253
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,982
Look, I can ask around for you, OK ?

254
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,819
- Thank you. I'd appreciate it.
- But you should stay.

255
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:55,490
Grab a drink and work some of that
massive tension out on the dance floor.

256
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,702
Well, you know what ? It smells like armpits
in here and I got a lot of work to do.

257
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,913
- There is more to life than policing.
- So I've heard !

258
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,637
If we had a house this big,
it would make sense to have another child.

259
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,140
It's a valuable lot.

260
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,978
Look at the lawn. It's so thick.
Be a great place for kids to play.

261
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,064
Zenith Zoysia.
Thrives in warm weather.

262
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,903
I'm not talking about grass, Dexter.

263
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,154
You're not ?

264
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,366
I've been trying to talk about the pregnancy
the whole way here.

265
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:41,203
Maybe you should be a little
less subtle in the future.

266
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,539
I'm trying not to pressure you.

267
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,001
But we have to make a decision
before one's made for us.

268
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,837
You're right, I know. OK.

269
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,309
Welcome. I'm so glad you came.

270
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,019
- Made it.
- Yeah. Hey.

271
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,229
- Hello.
- I'm Rita.

272
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,730
Miguel. Bienvenidos.

273
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,441
- So you've met Sylvia ?
- Syl, please.

274
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,903
- You guys have a beautiful home here.
- Great place for kids.

275
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,489
Come on, I'll give you the tour.

276
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,536
Strong family resemblance.

277
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,039
My father.

278
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,584
He was a drunk and a bastard
but he had a distinctive chin.

279
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,379
Some people just shouldn't
have kids, you know ?

280
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:36,550
- I wish there were a test.
- Yeah.

281
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,970
Oscar, he got the...
the best and the worst of Dad.

282
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,597
Me, I just tried to stay clear, you know ?

283
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,643
But, um...
I suppose he's in me too.

284
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,521
Hard to avoid.

285
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,982
Welcome.

286
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,737
I- I shouldn't drink.

287
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,283
What, are you pregnant ?

288
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,784
Uh...

289
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,369
You are.

290
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,954
Oh, my God, that's terrific.

291
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,665
Yeah... Yeah.

292
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,626
Or not.

293
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,628
That sounded really bad.

294
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,089
I meant...

295
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,467
Miguel and I have actually
been trying for a while now.

296
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,303
It even took once.

297
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:27,058
And Miguel, he wants to start a family
before he makes his run for the DA's office.

298
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:30,854
But I don't know.
I'm happy with the way things are.

299
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,981
I don't wanna force Dexter
into something.

300
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,525
That's kind of what happened
with the ex-husband.

301
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,861
Well, that and the fact
that he was a sociopath.

302
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:43,867
I had an ulterior motive
for inviting you here tonight.

303
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,369
Does it involve charging me
with a felony ?

304
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,706
No, the truth is, uh,

305
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,752
I wanted to talk to someone
inside of this investigation.

306
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,379
All I keep getting
is reassurances, reassurances.

307
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,214
Reassurances make me nervous.

308
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,800
You want me to put you at unease ?

309
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,178
I want you to be straight with me.

310
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:06,139
How certain are you
that this bastard Freebo will be found ?

311
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,853
Very.

312
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,190
- So I'm gonna get my shot at him in court ?
- Well, that could take a while.

313
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,610
Huh ? No, no, no. No more waiting.
I'm done waiting.

314
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,613
Is there another option ?

315
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,325
I'm an ADA.
My brother Ramon is a sheriff.

316
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,786
You don't think we got resources ?

317
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,247
If our lead pans out,
then we'll talk to Homicide.

318
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:33,541
You have a lead ? That's great.
How can I help ?

319
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,961
No, Ramon, you know,
he has his own way of doing things.

320
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,963
I don't wanna drag you into it.

321
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:42,801
You're talking to the guy you caught
breaking into your brother's secure files.

322
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,763
All right.

323
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,850
Well...

324
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,354
Ramon... may have...

325
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,147
borrowed a cell phone...

326
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,859
that belonged to Freebo's mother.

327
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,490
He calls mommy...
We can track him.

328
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,410
Mother's cell phone.
That's good thinking.

329
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,995
It may lead to nothing.

330
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:13,206
<i>Or it may lead them to Freebo
before I can get to him.</i>

331
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,167
<i>I need to check out Teegan's place
as soon as I can get out of here.</i>

332
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:25,927
<i>The hunt. My vision is much sharper
through the eyes of my shadow self.</i>

333
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,055
<i>If only I could see
this baby situation as clearly.</i>

334
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,850
<i>I promised Rita
I'd be back in an hour.</i>

335
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:35,020
<i>So she's nesting while I'm hunting,
stalking my prey.</i>

336
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,689
<i>I'll start with his prey - Teegan.</i>

337
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:42,027
<i>What she left behind will talk to me,
guide me to him.</i>

338
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,820
<i>Or...</i>

339
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,238
<i>to a kegger.</i>

340
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,566
- What's the password ?
- There's a password ?

341
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,652
I'm just looking for my girl Teegan.
Where's her room again ?

342
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,238
Ew, Teegan ?
Ew, that girl's a ho bag.

343
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,782
- She's a ho !
- She's such a ho bag.

344
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,117
She doesn't live here anymore.

345
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:34,329
She's ho'ing off campus,
probably living in her ho pad.

346
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,164
How about you give me
the address of her ho pad

347
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,291
so I can go tell her
what a ho bag she is ?

348
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,502
- You have any party favors ?
- Oh, yeah.

349
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,754
Uh, sorry. I don't have anything
on me, but...

350
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,132
- We put out.
- We totally do.

351
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,676
All right, that is
so totally off the hook.

352
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:52,514
But how about I just trade you
for Teegan's address ?

353
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,225
- OK.
- OK.

354
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:01,523
22 Lincoln Log.

355
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,358
I suspect that's Lincoln Lane ?

356
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,360
Whatever. Let's get high.

357
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,362
You two wait here.
I'll go get my stash.

358
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,571
OK.

359
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,577
<i>The leaders of tomorrow.</i>

360
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,791
<i>Their parents must be proud.</i>

361
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,002
<i>How much worse
could my child turn out ?</i>

362
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:26,881
<i>Do I even wanna know
the answer to that question ?</i>

363
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,385
<i>Teegan's ho pad will have
to wait till tomorrow night.</i>

364
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:34,556
<i>I've got a girlfriend and a baby
waiting on my promise to come back.</i>

365
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:38,601
<i>Is this what my life will be like - making
promises I'm not sure I wanna keep ?</i>

366
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,186
<i>It's complicated.</i>

367
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,565
<i>The pros and cons of responsibility.</i>

368
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,942
All right. Pros.

369
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,572
Can't we just talk ?

370
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,283
Sometimes lists are easier for me.

371
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,412
Give it ! It's my turn.

372
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,247
All right, pros.

373
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,084
Kids are cute.

374
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,295
You've already had it, Astor !

375
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,881
- Mom !
- No soccer in the house !

376
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,134
Cody !
I have to practice !

377
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,137
- Cons ?
- Noise.

378
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,222
Time. Money.

379
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,058
Stretch marks. Saggy boobs.

380
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,228
Less personal freedom.

381
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:27,901
Personal... freedom.

382
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,030
All right, I thought I said no soccer
in the house.

383
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,491
Now just go to your room
until it's time for school.

384
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,870
Oh !

385
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,747
Son of a...

386
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:42,957
Ohh.

387
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,588
What am I even thinking ?

388
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,567
- Zack Adelman ?
- Yeah.

389
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,819
We need to talk to you
about Fred Bowman.

390
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:12,987
Who ?

391
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,658
Your pal, Freebo. The dealer
you got busted with two years ago.

392
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,493
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

393
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:24,415
Um, yeah, I haven't seen him
in, like, uh, two years.

394
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,502
You mind if we come in, Zack ?

395
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:31,297
He actually doesn't have
a choice, Sergeant. He's a parolee.

396
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,050
- Oh, gosh, you're right.
- Yeah.

397
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,435
Couldn't find anything new
on your Jane Doe, sorry.

398
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,770
How's it going ?

399
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,731
Backward.
I don't even think Jane was a hooker.

400
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,402
Bummer. So who you looking for ?

401
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,195
Her dealer.

402
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,322
What the fuck is scrapbooking ?

403
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,784
The tradition of putting
photos and memorabilia

404
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,496
into family keepsake albums,
along with relevant journaling.

405
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,707
I don't even want to know
how you know that.

406
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,793
So do you know which dealer...

407
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,421
Morgan.

408
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,881
Yeah.

409
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,759
Got it. I'll meet you there.

410
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,220
Might have found
some luck of my own.

411
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,139
The lead on Jane's ID.

412
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:27,603
As soon as it gets dark, I'm back on
the hunt so I can stay ahead of my sister.

413
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,024
This department is becoming
annoyingly effective.

414
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,817
You home alone here, Zack ?

415
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,528
Totally.

416
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,740
Get on your knees. Put your hands
on your head. Don't move !

417
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,367
Wait ! It's just a cat, man.

418
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,703
- It's cool, guys !
- Shut the fuck up !

419
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,126
Hi.

420
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,670
Oh, this fuckin' paperwork's
gonna take forever.

421
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,423
Come on, drop it.
Drop it ! Come on.

422
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,633
Just a few pills, man.
What's the big deal ?

423
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,470
The big deal is you're making me cancel
on a very willing woman.

424
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,307
- Get on your knees next to your boyfriend.
- Let's make a deal, then. Let's trade...

425
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,225
Stop there, asshole.

426
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,728
We don't got time to process
a bribery charge too.

427
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,273
I'm not offering you cash, man.
I've got valuable information.

428
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,649
On Freebo ?

429
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,777
Even better.

430
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,153
Chicky Hines.

431
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,447
Who the fuck is Chicky Hines ?

432
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,492
Chicky Hines just went down
on a carjacking homicide.

433
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,952
He's waiting on sentencing now.

434
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,413
Yeah, this guy Zack says
Hines didn't do the crime.

435
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,957
He's offering up an alibi for Hines
and another suspect.

436
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,877
I know all about
the Chicky Hines case.

437
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,963
He was a big win for the prosecutor,
and guess who that was.

438
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,841
- Shit.
- Yeah, Miguel Prado.

439
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,553
So now, not only won't I be bringing him
good news about his brother's case.

440
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,473
Worse - I'm gonna undermine
his latest conviction.

441
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,601
- Think that's what he wants to hear ?
- Doubtful.

442
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,896
Christ, vet this.
Oh, yeah, vet this.

443
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:55,483
Completely. I wanna be absolutely certain
that this is solid

444
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,528
before I even think about
bringing it to Miguel.

445
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,908
Hey, Angel.

446
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,413
Case going all right ?

447
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,959
No leads, no insights ?

448
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,003
Just the pressure, bro.

449
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,215
Expected to make decisions,
take responsibility.

450
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,884
You don't know what it's like.

451
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,595
Probably like finding out
your girlfriend's pregnant.

452
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,182
- Rita's pregnant ?
- Looks like it.

453
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,353
Holy shit.

454
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,355
That's fantastic.

455
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,524
It is ?

456
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,777
My little girl
is the best thing I ever did.

457
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:45,241
I've messed up a lot.
But in my darkest hours, Auri's my light.

458
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,951
You wait and see.

459
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,828
OK.

460
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,621
Thank you.

461
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,832
I feel better.

462
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,797
<i>A light.</i>

463
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,382
<i>Hmm.</i>

464
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,676
<i>Is that even possible ?</i>

465
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,101
Higher, Daddy !

466
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,982
Dexter, come play with us !

467
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,822
Ah !

468
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,617
Come play with us, Daddy.

469
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,827
I'm right behind you, buddy.

470
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,211
You're it, baby.

471
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,176
Cody and Astor
would be older, you know.

472
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,512
I like them this age.

473
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,934
I always wanted
to be a grandfather.

474
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,646
I think we're better off without you.

475
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,442
Well, it's a beautiful family
you got there, Dex.

476
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,779
<i>You couldn't picture this, could you ?</i>

477
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,158
<i>I could have surprised you.</i>

478
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:13,788
<i>Yeah, there's no reason
it couldn't turn out like this.</i>

479
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,415
Astor !

480
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:20,419
- Astor !
- Astor !

481
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:33,891
What have you done ?!

482
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:49,115
Yo, Morgan.

483
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,829
Where the hell have you been ?

484
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,872
Street wasn't clear, yo.

485
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,333
I get spotted with you,
no more trusty CI.

486
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,835
Fine. What have you got ?

487
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:04,171
All right, apartment six. Pimp named Javier,
completely new to the game,

488
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:06,841
but he already has a rep
for his stable of white girls.

489
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,386
If your Jane Doe is a strawberry,
chances are he tried to recruit her.

490
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,388
- This is good. Thank you.
- Yeah.

491
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,062
You get spotted with me,
no more trusty CI.

492
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,150
- Yeah, but he likes 'em white.
- Does he like 'em strapped ?

493
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,320
All right, it's cool. But I'll be here,
anything goes sideways.

494
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,497
Miami Metro.
I'm looking for Javier.

495
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:39,665
Entra, por favor.

496
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,219
You're a little young to be
in business for yourself.

497
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,181
I'm a wonder kid.

498
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,684
OK. Can you identify this woman ?

499
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,439
You'd make a shitload more money on
all fours than you do as a cop, mamita.

500
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,316
Oh, like I haven't heard that before.

501
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:10,529
Look, little one, give me a name for this girl,
I won't bust you for being a piece of shit.

502
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,074
Never seen her. Humph.

503
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,035
Besides, she looks
too used up to be an earner.

504
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,871
But you, damn, mami.

505
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,165
I could get you a thou a night.

506
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,086
Give you some spending money
for, uh, extracurricular activities.

507
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,004
Think I need to hear that ?

508
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,756
- Ohh !
- You sleazy piece of shit !

509
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,343
I'm a cop ! That's all I need !
I'm not gonna do any fucking scrapbooking !

510
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,427
Scrapbooking ?

511
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:35,262
You fucked her.

512
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,599
Ohh !

513
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,893
You've seen her ?

514
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,520
On his dick.

515
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,981
Hey, she's fading. She doesn't even know
what she's talking about.

516
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,109
I think she does, and I think you fucked
a girl who's now dead.

517
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:53,572
Fuck. Look, I picked her up at some party.
All right ? I thought that I could turn her out.

518
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,075
- What's her name ?
- I don't know !

519
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,868
Bitch, cunt, "hey, you. "

520
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,578
Yeah ?

521
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,165
This doesn't look good, Javier.

522
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,419
I passed her to a friend
who could feed her habit better than I could.

523
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,922
- A friend, right.
- Yeah, yeah, a white guy named Freebo.

524
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:12,967
Freebo ?

525
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,303
Yeah, yeah. He could deal with her shit
longer than I could.

526
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,514
Maybe he's a patient guy.
I don't know.

527
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,141
Yeah, maybe not.

528
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,602
<i>If my first stab at Freebo
had gone as planned,</i>

529
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,856
<i>Oscar Prado might still be alive,
Miguel wouldn't know who I was,</i>

530
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,066
<i>Teegan would have lived
to ho another day,</i>

531
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,360
<i>and Deb wouldn't be chasing
a Jane Doe.</i>

532
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:35,322
<i>And I wouldn't be watching the clock,
counting the minutes till darkness comes,</i>

533
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,450
<i>trying to get the jump
on my friends in blue.</i>

534
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,285
Anything ?

535
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,288
Uh, running additional DNA tests
on Oscar Prado's clothing.

536
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,416
If Freebo's cut himself,
his blood could be on these clothes.

537
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,669
Slam dunk in court.
Is there a chance ?

538
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,172
<i>- Not even remotely.
- Good.</i>

539
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,177
Any idea what your sister found ?

540
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,805
- She found something ?
- I'm asking you.

541
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:04,727
She left a message saying she was vetting
a big lead that's gonna make me happy.

542
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,729
No idea.

543
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,689
Got the call. I'm getting published.

544
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,233
- Hey.
- Congratulations. The shrine worked.

545
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,360
Totally.

546
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,704
Freebo just called his mother's cell phone.
I'll have his address by tonight.

547
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,581
And then you will let me
deal with him.

548
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:29,084
Ramon, you've done your job.
I'm gonna take it from here, OK ?

549
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,420
- Go be with your family.
- Don't fucking sideline me on this, Miguel.

550
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,671
Ramon.

551
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,381
Hey, Maria.

552
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:37,384
Hey. Your assistant told me
you were here.

553
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,763
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria ?
- Ramon.

554
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,891
Well, we're working
on some new angles.

555
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,769
- Mm-hm. Which means you've got shit.
- Excuse us.

556
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,773
Oye, coño. Go home.

557
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,026
Cause you're not helping here.

558
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:04,411
- Ramon and his temper.
- Yeah, I remember.

559
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,913
But... I get it.

560
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,291
I mean, him and Oscar were close.

561
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,461
Miguel, I need to talk to you
about something else.

562
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,506
Uh-oh.
I remember that look.

563
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,431
Chicky Hines.

564
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:25,766
OK.

565
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:28,978
He didn't do
that carjacking homicide.

566
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:33,107
We found new evidence,
and it checks out, Miguel.

567
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,568
I think you convicted the wrong man.

568
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,321
You're serious ?

569
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:45,035
I was gonna wait, I mean...
The timing is...

570
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,287
Shit.

571
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,290
But if Hines is innocent, Miguel...

572
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,919
Miguel, I'm sorry.

573
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:59,466
Oh, this is frustrating
and disappointing.

574
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:03,929
And, uh... I really hate my job right now.

575
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:10,519
But, hey... Don't ever think
about holding back on me.

576
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,648
OK ? Just like now, you tell me straight.

577
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:17,860
That's the Maria
that I've always counted on.

578
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,029
And always can.

579
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,826
When all of this is behind us,
I want to get together.

580
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,829
Hmm ? The three of us.

581
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,166
You know, as friends.
It's long overdue.

582
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,633
Night time.

583
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:53,938
Why do you think
Freebo's still in town ?

584
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:54,897
Why do you think
Freebo's still in town ?

585
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,358
Because I think he killed
his girlfriend on Sunday.

586
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,026
Jane Doe.

587
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,778
How do you know
it's his girlfriend ?

588
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,447
The CI gave me a lead.
I did some follow-up.

589
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:07,743
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. My CI ?
- Do you have a name for Jane yet ?

590
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,330
No, but she was strangled,
which is consistent with Freebo's MO.

591
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,751
If you're right, the Oscar Prado
and Jane Doe cases are linked.

592
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:19,296
I guess we'll just
have to merge them.

593
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,763
Freebo's still out there killing.
We've got to catch him fast.

594
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:32,643
But we got a lead now. We find
the girlfriend's ID, we find her place,

595
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,979
her friends, her family,
then we find him.

596
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,774
- I'll coordinate with the Feds.
- Ramos, reach out to street patrol.

597
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:45,447
Anton is my contact.
If you wear him out or blow his cover...

598
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,033
I know how to work a CI, Quinn,

599
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,079
so unless there's some other reason
you don't want me to talk to him...

600
00:38:55,792 --> 00:39:00,087
Hey... Solid police work, Morgan.
That's how you earn your shield.

601
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,549
- Thanks, Sarge.
- All right.

602
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,760
All right, people.
We're gonna be working late on this.

603
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,763
<i>I'll be working late too.</i>

604
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,896
<i>Ho pad indeed.</i>

605
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:44,048
<i>All right, Teegan, tell me where
your homicidal beau might be.</i>

606
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,812
<i>Freebo. Hiding out
at his dead girlfriend's house ?</i>

607
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,147
<i>Risky.</i>

608
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:04,651
<i>Then again, it took me a while to find this
place and I knew who I was looking for.</i>

609
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,617
<i>No tools, no syringe,
no kill room, no sure thing.</i>

610
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,829
<i>Hang tight, Freebo.
I'll be back before you know it.</i>

611
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,962
<i>Detached garage.
Perfect place for a kill room.</i>

612
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:35,849
<i>M-6 bayonet, Vietnam-era.
A family keepsake, maybe ?</i>

613
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,018
<i>Oscar tried to kill Freebo with it.</i>

614
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,687
<i>It's only fitting I use it
to complete the task.</i>

615
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:43,816
<i>Shit.</i>

616
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,505
It's time for a decision, Dexter.

617
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,054
Having this child is a huge mistake.

618
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,516
I've weighed out all the pros and cons,
and all I've got are cons.

619
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,232
I've been thinking the same thing.

620
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,443
I'm keeping it.

621
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:36,702
I've made a lot of mistakes in my life
but being a mother was never one of them.

622
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,706
Dexter, I'd rather do this with you.

623
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,791
But I've been a single parent
for a long time now,

624
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,461
and I think Astor and Cody prove
that I'm pretty damn good at it.

625
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,757
Is this you being subtle again ?

626
00:41:54,888 --> 00:42:01,143
No, this is me, in all sincerity,
saying I will honor your choice.

627
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,563
This child is happening.

628
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,900
But your role in its life
is entirely up to you.

629
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,825
<i>Should I take the out Rita gave me ?</i>

630
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:21,830
<i>What kind of father would I be ?
After all, I kill people.</i>

631
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:44,353
Agh !

632
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,730
Long time, no see.

633
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:03,163
Oh, God.
What the hell is this ?!

634
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,503
Show and tell.

635
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:16,760
It's been so long since you killed them,
I was afraid you'd... forgotten.

636
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,847
Though I'm sure Teegan
is fresh in your mind.

637
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,195
I didn't...

638
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,989
Aah ! Fuck !

639
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,326
Ohh.

640
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,453
You killed those girls
in the Everglades

641
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,248
and you got away with it
on a bad warrant.

642
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,375
I love those.

643
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,878
And then Teegan came along.

644
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:14,318
First, you drained her
of her self-respect and hope.

645
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:19,531
Then last Sunday,
you choked the life out of her.

646
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,700
No, last Sunday...

647
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:25,078
I was gettin' high with...
it was Cheri or... Carrie.

648
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,749
She's at... She's at...
She's at Alpha Fee...

649
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,215
You seem uncertain.

650
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,761
It's uncomfortable, isn't it ?

651
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,973
Just when you think you've answered
all the questions,

652
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,850
another one smacks you in the face.

653
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,436
Life, life, life.

654
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,648
<i>Life is just like that.</i>

655
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,782
<i>Which is why I prefer death.</i>

656
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,046
Dexter ?

657
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,007
Is that you ?

658
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,058
I had the phone records.

659
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,686
Well, what are...

660
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,731
Is he in there ?

661
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,905
Alive ?

662
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,883
It was self-defense.

663
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,559
I found a forensics lead.

664
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,980
It was a long shot.
I wanted to check it out before...

665
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:00,066
I wasted anyone's time.

666
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:03,111
I didn't expect Freebo to be here.

667
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,947
He surprised me. He jumped me...

668
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,116
with this knife.

669
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:12,245
That looks like my father's knife from...
from Vietnam. He gave that to Oscar.

670
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,047
I didn't know what to do.
I fought back.

671
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,349
The knife ended up in his neck.

672
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,150
- I...
- I'm gonna tell you something.

673
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,321
I wasn't sure that I could do this.

674
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,783
But you did. You did.

675
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,331
- We're gonna get rid of the evidence.
- No. No !

676
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,958
- You should leave. Now.
- No !

677
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:00,126
Plausible deniability.

678
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,428
