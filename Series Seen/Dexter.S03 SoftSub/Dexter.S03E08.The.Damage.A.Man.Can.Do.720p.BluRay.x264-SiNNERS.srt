1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,796
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:06,923
We need to go after the root cause,

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,717
this bloodsucking,
soulless defense attorney Ellen Wolf !

4
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,553
Has she, uh, ever actually killed anyone ?

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,930
Keep an open mind about her.

6
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,890
Miguel's on his way over here right now.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,143
I know one side of him.
Maybe there's more.

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,689
Missing evidence, witness intimidation,
jury tampering.

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,650
- You got proof ?
- He's a bad guy. He's not a stupid guy.

10
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:26,734
I'm pregnant.

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,695
They say this part should pass soon.

12
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,824
This isn't some kind of weird end run, is it ?

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,909
Make me see how sensitive
you really are ?

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,869
- I'm not all that sensitive.
- Yeah, you are.

15
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,749
Someone loaned Freebo some money
and is willing to skin people to get it back.

16
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,293
Which is why I want to use
our CI more aggressively.

17
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,420
Wait. You mean Anton ?

18
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,423
Yeah, we're gonna spread the word
that Anton knows where Freebo is.

19
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,674
You're gonna use him as bait ?

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,343
Which means that the Skinner
will be looking for me.

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,553
Am I being set up ?

22
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,139
I found the fucking lead
on the Skinner case, OK ?

23
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,058
The Skinner is using tree-trimming
as a cover for surveillance.

24
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,562
He watches from the trees
and when the time is right, he grabs them.

25
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,230
I know what you did for me.

26
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,024
I will be your bait.

27
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,445
So you told Quinn I was investigating him.

28
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,156
Hey, you're the one who fucked him.
Not my fault he didn't want an encore.

29
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:16,117
A cop's dead cause Quinn
cut all the wrong corners.

30
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,577
Next dead cop's on you.

31
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,747
What did it feel like to end his life ?

32
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,248
Felt like justice.

33
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,710
We're like-minded.
Together we can make a difference.

34
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,957
<i>It's said that everything
is connected to everything.</i>

35
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,668
<i>The butterfly effect.</i>

36
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,130
<i>You drop a pebble into a pond
and the ripples radiate outwards,</i>

37
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,799
<i>touching and affecting everything.</i>

38
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:43,264
<i>Until finally a fish grows arms and legs
and crawls out of the water.</i>

39
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,475
<i>And picks up a rock and smashes
the next two fish over the head.</i>

40
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,312
<i>And we have the first serial killer.</i>

41
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,064
Mm.

42
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,235
This is good pizza.

43
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,614
- What channel's ESPN over here ?
- Uh...

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,491
I think it's a big number.

45
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,203
Yeah, there you go.

46
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,916
And now we got Gary
going the other way. Trying to get in.

47
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,125
Oh !

48
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,170
No way ! That's not a foul, man !

49
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,673
That was definitely wrong
what that guy did.

50
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,385
You're clearly not a sports fan, are you ?

51
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,845
Not really.

52
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,014
I'm more of a National Geographic
kinda guy.

53
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,600
Sharks, bears, the occasional penguin.

54
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,938
- You do have other interests, though.
- Yeah, I suppose I do.

55
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,025
Speaking of which...

56
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,113
<i>Uh-uh. Boundaries.</i>

57
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,825
Yeah, it's encrypted.

58
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,994
Oh, yeah, that's right. Trust issues.

59
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,956
Mm-hm.

60
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,673
- Football.
- See ? You do know your sports.

61
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:03,761
This guy right here. Billy Fleeter.

62
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,057
- Should I know him ?
- Not yet, but hopefully you will.

63
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,601
This was from maybe five years ago.

64
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,021
He never went pro.
Drug problem. Turned to gambling.

65
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,315
Unfortunately, he wasn't very good at it.

66
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,944
More than once he's paid his debts off
to his bookies by working as an enforcer.

67
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,195
Breaking fingers ?

68
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,948
Crushing skulls with a baseball bat.

69
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:29,203
I went after him a few years ago, but, uh,
I just couldn't get the evidence.

70
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,457
I had to tell the children
of a 70-year-old man that he had just killed,

71
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,626
that there was nothing we could do.

72
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,714
<i>So here it comes.
Miguel wants me to kill him.</i>

73
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,257
I don't want you to kill him.

74
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,550
No ?

75
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,679
I wanna do it.

76
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,681
You.

77
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,184
I've let you do all of the heavy lifting so far.
Now it's my turn.

78
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,312
I'm ready to get my hands dirty.

79
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,239
<i>It's one thing
to let Miguel provide a little backup,</i>

80
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,867
<i>another thing to share the reins with him.</i>

81
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,244
I'm gonna need your help, Dexter.

82
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,080
Not a good idea.

83
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,668
Just, uh, think about it.

84
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,381
No, Dexter,
don't think about it.

85
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:28,220
The waffle is a lot like the pancake,
only square.

86
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,805
Why is it square ?

87
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,475
Because it was invented
by Simon P Waffle

88
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,478
and he liked to stack his waffles in boxes,

89
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,022
and that's just easier to do
if they're square.

90
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,024
You're making that up.

91
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,985
I'm hurt that you would even think that.

92
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,613
Oh, God, Dexter,
you're making a mess.

93
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,449
- That's OK. We'll clean it up.
- It's not the point.

94
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,702
- What is the point ?
- I don't know.

95
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,039
The point is not to make
a mess to begin with.

96
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,000
<i>Rita's pregnancy hormones seem to be
ganging up on us this morning.</i>

97
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,419
How come there are no English muffins left ?

98
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,963
Uh, I think you ate
the last one yesterday. Waffle ?

99
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,965
That's disgusting.

100
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,509
Cody, you need a haircut.

101
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,262
<i>Let's see...
four, five, six more months till she delivers.</i>

102
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,557
- Rita, are you OK ?
- No, I'm not OK.

103
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,477
I'm starting a new job
and I'm planning a wedding all by myself.

104
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,812
What can I do to help ?

105
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,648
It's not like you can pick out the DJ.

106
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,651
Last time I got into your car,
your radio was tuned to marching music.

107
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,069
It helps me think.

108
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,322
And it's not like you can pick the florist
or the caterer or even the wedding bands.

109
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,491
I could pick the wedding bands.

110
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,993
Right. Like the engagement ring
you never gave me.

111
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,621
- You said you didn't want one.
- I don't want one.

112
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,834
Who drank all the orange juice ?

113
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,175
- Jesus Christ.
- What ?

114
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,681
- You have like no hot water in your shower.
- Right.

115
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,184
- I told you to wait, remember ?
- I can't wait.

116
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,687
Some of us have jobs to get to.

117
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,522
I'm a musician. I work nights.

118
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,275
Yeah, and what do you do
with the rest of your day ?

119
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,277
You take a nap, you watch cartoons.

120
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,862
Jack off.

121
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,115
- Oh, I rarely watch cartoons.
- Fucking hilarious.

122
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,992
Mm.

123
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,248
Well, you better not be writing
any more songs about me.

124
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,833
Most ladies would be flattered.

125
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,544
Well, most ladies aren't cops.

126
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,797
Oh, right, right.

127
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,985
I gotta go.

128
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:50,696
Yeah, OK.

129
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,241
Come get these.

130
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,035
Yeah.

131
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,084
<i>Freebo's dead,</i>

132
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:07,087
<i>and now there's a tree-trimmers'
convention in here.</i>

133
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,715
<i>It seems random, but it's not.</i>

134
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,426
<i>The butterfly effect again.</i>

135
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,138
<i>Of course, it's an odd sensation
when you happen to be the butterfly.</i>

136
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,474
<i>And if I were to help Miguel
kill Billy Fleeter,</i>

137
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,435
<i>who knows the effect
that would have on the world ?</i>

138
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,230
<i>Is this the beginning
of a whole new level of friendship ?</i>

139
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,524
<i>Is it the end of life as I know it ?</i>

140
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,239
Mr. King. We met at the scene
of our second victim, is that correct ?

141
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,615
Yes, that is correct.

142
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,660
Have you ever worked
at any of these addresses ?

143
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,247
No, no, see, these are city jobs.

144
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,957
I'm a private contractor.

145
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,793
OK, well, I'm gonna need
a list of all of your employees.

146
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,504
I can get you a copy
of my payroll records.

147
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,797
That would be a big help.

148
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:53,759
- How soon do you need this ?
- Ten minutes ago would be great.

149
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,386
- Very well.
- Thank you.

150
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,112
Looks like someone got lucky last night.

151
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,740
Uh, let's just say that Barbara and I
have taken it to the next level.

152
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,743
You know that now you've done the deed,
she's gonna be taking notes,

153
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,455
making a checklist of your every move,
to see if you're relationship material.

154
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,249
That's not true. Wait, is it ?

155
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,210
Well, it's not like
we write anything down.

156
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,213
It's... more of a mental process.

157
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,510
Morning, Loo.

158
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,178
Third day in a row of this, huh ?

159
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,681
Let's hope something
shakes loose on this. Come here.

160
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:44,435
- Uh, I have a favor to ask you, OK ?
- Shoot.

161
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,480
I gotta go to that peace officers
association thing tomorrow night.

162
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,233
You wanna... You wanna be my date ?

163
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,821
Maria, um, thank you for the invite.

164
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,658
But I have plans. And if I bail,
I don't think it's gonna go over too well.

165
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,245
Like that. Huh.

166
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,457
- OK. Good for you.
- OK.

167
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,839
<i>Relationships are complicated.</i>

168
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,884
<i>Letting Miguel kill Fleeter
would be a gamble.</i>

169
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,803
<i>This guy's a gambler.
Look where it got him.</i>

170
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,140
<i>Something to consider when Miguel and I
do our research tonight at the casino.</i>

171
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,111
How'd you find out about this place ?

172
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,404
Research.

173
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,656
Always a first good step, right ?

174
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,410
Move a little closer ?

175
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,163
Tonight is just about watching,
learning his routine.

176
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,083
Where does he go and when,
what does he do when he gets there.

177
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,168
- OK.
- Later, we'll meet him.

178
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,128
We ?

179
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,173
Yeah, we'll see how it goes.

180
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,052
Right now, we don't want him to notice us.
We don't want anyone to notice us.

181
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,930
Cameras all over the place.

182
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,642
Number one rule of the code
is "don't get caught".

183
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,185
Code ? What code ?

184
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,105
<i>How much do I tell him ?</i>

185
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,649
It's just a series of precautions.

186
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,526
Learned where ?

187
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,906
- Common sense mostly.
- A little more than that.

188
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,034
- Well, my dad was a cop.
- Right. So he taught you...

189
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,828
What cops look for in an investigation.

190
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,247
Oh, and so you work it backwards
from there, right ?

191
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,084
Plus I spend all day looking at other
people's mistakes. You pick things up.

192
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,086
I'm sure.

193
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,756
Am I forgetting something, Dexter ?

194
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,466
Was there one final lesson

195
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,804
where I said, "Go now, far and wide,
and preach the code, my son" ?

196
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,472
I don't think so.

197
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:52,020
So when you popped Anton for drug
possession, was it just pot, was it coke...

198
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,190
- What was it ?
- Uh, pot, I think.

199
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:59,445
Right. It couldn't have been anything too
serious or you wouldn't have made him a CI.

200
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,946
I guess.

201
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,866
- You're just full of answers today.
- No, it's...

202
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,661
I just busted guys like him every day.
I don't remember.

203
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,624
- And it's all written down somewhere.
- Right. CI files.

204
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,759
Hello ?

205
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,470
Hey, lazy, hope I'm waking you up.

206
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,264
Hey, lazy ?
I haven't been to bed yet.

207
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,976
Look, I need your CI number.
I'm gonna file a status report.

208
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,311
What's a CI number ?

209
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,439
Your assigned
confidential informant number.

210
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,441
It should be on your paychecks.

211
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,319
What checks ?

212
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,071
Hello, your paychecks from the county.

213
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,826
Hello, I don't get any paychecks.
Quinn always pays me in cash.

214
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,665
Oh. OK. I'll get it from him, then.

215
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,631
My client was supposed
to be sent to County yesterday.

216
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:04,551
Apparently he was, but then they put him
on the next bus back here in the afternoon.

217
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,347
- I've been chasing him all over the place.
- We shouldn't have those mix-ups.

218
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,558
Is it a mix-up,
or is Miguel fucking with me ?

219
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,393
Ever since I started looking into him,

220
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,271
he's been going out of his way
to make my job harder.

221
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,106
Well, you knew that was gonna happen.

222
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:20,192
Doesn't mean I can't bitch about it.

223
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,820
Oh, anyway, I should go see my client

224
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,242
and ask what perfectly logical reason he had
for lighting his ex-wife's house on fire.

225
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,910
Oh, I wanted to ask you.

226
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:35,207
Any chance you'd go to a police
charity function with me tomorrow night ?

227
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,792
Hmm ?

228
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,128
Room full of cops ?
I can't imagine anything more fun.

229
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,589
Shouldn't have asked.

230
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,216
I'm kidding. I'd love to go.

231
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,723
OK, next on your list, Mr. King,
Santiago Ramirez.

232
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,768
He no longer works for me.
That didn't end so well.

233
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,937
- Why ?
- He was run over.

234
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,358
Uh, Mario Astorga. Didn't I talk to him ?

235
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,194
Yes, if you remember, he's the one
who found the body of that man.

236
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,487
Right. Second victim.

237
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,575
- Mario's one of my best foremen.
- So he's a good guy ?

238
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,786
What, he's not a good guy ?

239
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,332
He has a temper. He gets very angry.

240
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,459
Keep going.

241
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,045
I knew his family back in Nicaragua.

242
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,089
We're both from San Marcos.

243
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,341
- But Mario had to leave.
- Why ?

244
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,053
The police were looking for him.

245
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,056
I heard he killed someone with a knife.

246
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,520
Do you know where I can find Mario ?

247
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,982
I don't know where he lives.
But tomorrow, he'll be at Bayside Park.

248
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,192
- You sure ?
- I make the schedule.

249
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,660
<i>Fleeter pays off his gambling debts
by eliminating people for his bookie.</i>

250
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,288
<i>A schoolteacher here,
a mother of two there.</i>

251
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,998
<i>People who can't settle their debts.</i>

252
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,209
<i>Sending a message to others, "Pay up".</i>

253
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:05,505
<i>Do I help Miguel move forward on this,
or do I listen to Harry and shut it down ?</i>

254
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,135
Hey, you.

255
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,555
Yeah, I just heard a love song on the radio
that reminded me of you.

256
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,973
Oh, that's sweet.

257
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,392
- And it made me really angry.
- Oh.

258
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,478
So have you gotten the wedding bands yet ?

259
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,481
Um, I'm still doing my research,
but I'm on it.

260
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,151
I gotta go.

261
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,120
Hey, you know anything
about wedding rings ?

262
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,167
Yeah. Wedding rings and nuclear fission
are like my secret specialties.

263
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,961
Thanks.

264
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,838
Your brother's kind of a dweeb, huh ?

265
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,174
You say anything more about my brother

266
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,177
and I will kick your fucking nuts
down your throat.

267
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,971
That doesn't even make
any sense.

268
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,352
So, hey, Anton doesn't have any priors,

269
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,355
you pay him in cash,
and I can't find him in the CI database.

270
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,273
Should be in there.

271
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,567
What are you hiding ?

272
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,570
Anton is not officially a CI.

273
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,116
- What do you mean ?
- Come here for a second.

274
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,249
Look, it was just easier for both of us.

275
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,086
I never filed an arrest report on him
so he has no police record.

276
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,923
I did him a favor. Plus, it saved me
the hassle of all that paperwork.

277
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,926
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

278
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,722
We used him as bait.

279
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:40,684
He was putting his life at risk, and he was
under no legal obligation to help us.

280
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,978
No, there was just no paperwork, that's all.

281
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,772
Not to mention that,
because he's not officially a CI,

282
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,150
there's no end date
to when he's done working for us

283
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,568
so you can just string him along
as long as you want to.

284
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:54,448
What are you getting so upset about ?
What, are you in love with the guy ?

285
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,199
No, I'm not in love with him.

286
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,327
But you're sleeping with him.

287
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,206
Jesus Christ, do you know what kind
of a bonehead mistake that is ?

288
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,126
Sleeping with an informant ?
That'll screw up your career.

289
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,004
- He's not an informant. You just said it.
- But you didn't know.

290
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,716
- Either way, it makes you look stupid.
- You don't get to lecture me, asshole.

291
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,762
Anton could so easily file a huge lawsuit
against the police department

292
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:19,055
once he finds out how you fucked him over !

293
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,099
If someone told him.

294
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,560
Of course I'm gonna tell him.

295
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,022
You'll sell out a cop
for some dope you're fucking ?

296
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,486
That's not half as bad as being responsible
for another cop dying

297
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,905
because you don't like to play by the rules.

298
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,200
What ?

299
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,119
Yuki told me.

300
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,831
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about !

301
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,095
<i>Despite Harry's warnings,</i>

302
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,307
<i>here I am with Miguel,
outside Billy Fleeter's house.</i>

303
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,694
<i>If I'm gonna stop this,
it's gonna have to be soon.</i>

304
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:17,531
Are you sure you want to do this ?
It's breaking and entering.

305
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,492
- But you know that.
- Yes, I do. Let's go.

306
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,870
Here, put these on.

307
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,293
Forensics guy who always has
latex gloves on him.

308
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,337
No one would ever think twice, huh ?

309
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,341
I guess you're right.

310
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,184
<i>I don't want Miguel to see
how easy this is for me.</i>

311
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,522
Uh, you want me to try ?

312
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,859
No, I think I...

313
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,654
I got it.

314
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,787
So what are we looking for ?

315
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,707
Proof. That he's guilty.

316
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:15,088
We know he bludgeons people to death,
so look for something... bludgeony.

317
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:26,057
Uh, this looks like it's been
knocked around some.

318
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,104
Hold it up.

319
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,945
Purple ?

320
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,447
Ergo...

321
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,698
Blood.

322
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,408
How easy is this ?

323
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,704
I'll test it against the blood of his
alleged victims. Let you know later today.

324
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,040
You know it takes me two days
to get a search warrant,

325
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,917
then another day
to catalogue evidence,

326
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,169
and then a week before I can
get the lab results.

327
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,463
This is definitely the way to go.

328
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,549
We also need to make sure
that he's likely to kill again.

329
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,553
- Why is that ?
- It's just one of the rules.

330
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,182
One of these days I'm gonna make you sit
down and write out all these rules for me.

331
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,392
He-He kills whenever he needs money.

332
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,145
That's how he pays off
his debts to the bookie.

333
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,482
Dex, I've tried a lot of these gamblers
before, and they all keep records.

334
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:20,111
They're, like, anal about their numbers.
There's got to be, like, a ledger somewhere.

335
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,281
Maybe there's a hidden wall safe
or something.

336
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,826
We're talking about the man who leaves
his murder weapon in an umbrella stand.

337
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,120
You're right.
What if we don't find anything ?

338
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,122
Then we don't move forward.

339
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:46,388
Leave it, Dex.
Just put it back.

340
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:50,475
You can stop this right now.
Call it off.

341
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,477
Why should I call it off ?

342
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:56,648
I didn't teach you the code
to share with your buddies.

343
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,858
I taught you the code
to keep you alive.

344
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,028
You don't get to have friends, Dexter.

345
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,031
Nothing good can come out of this.

346
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,450
Hey, Dex, you know what ?

347
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,953
I don't think we're gonna
find anything here, man.

348
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,205
Look at you.

349
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,082
It's my life, Dad.

350
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,583
30 grand in the hole.

351
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,169
I think we know how he's gonna pay that off.

352
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,551
So, look, we moving forward ?

353
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,053
Yeah, moving forward.

354
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,972
If the blood matches.

355
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,478
I can't believe we are just now
sending out invitations.

356
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,813
This is so last-minute.

357
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,399
It's OK. There's plenty of time.

358
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,775
And Dexter's no help.

359
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,611
I asked him for menu suggestions -
do you know what he says ?

360
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,196
I don't know.

361
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,824
Steak. He says steak.

362
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,827
Yeah, that's great, Dexter.
That's really great.

363
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,246
We'll start with a steak appetizer,

364
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,666
followed by steak salad,
followed, of course, by a steak.

365
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,211
And then, of course, it'll all be topped off
by a steak fucking cake.

366
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,796
Rita.

367
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,549
- Rita.
- What ?

368
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,218
The envelope.
You're making a mess.

369
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,097
Oh...

370
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,682
Shit.

371
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,811
Why don't you stuff for a while ?
I'll do the addresses.

372
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,022
OK.

373
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,446
I've got big news.

374
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,074
Yeah, about the Skinner ?

375
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,534
No, about you.

376
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,664
You're free.

377
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,375
Oh, yeah, ever since Abe Lincoln.

378
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,878
I mean from the police department.

379
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,592
You're no longer a CI.

380
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:52,347
Wait a second. The way Quinn
explained it was, that if I play ball,

381
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,809
it would knock down my felony possession
to a misdemeanor,

382
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,144
and if I worked hard enough,
it would go away altogether.

383
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,730
Well, it's gone away.

384
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,610
Hmm, how's that ?

385
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,989
Clerical error.

386
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,325
The necessary papers were never filed,

387
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,370
so there were never any charges
for you to work off.

388
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,831
So I've been doing all this shit
when I didn't have to ?

389
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,833
Just be glad you don't
have to do it anymore.

390
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,584
Hmm.

391
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,172
Well, thank you.

392
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,385
And I want to put protective detail on you.

393
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,554
What ? No. No, Debra.

394
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,681
- Anton.
- Listen. You said I'm free,

395
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,599
so I'm free of this.

396
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,018
- So we should celebrate.
- Dinner tonight.

397
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,729
Mm, no, I'm working tonight.

398
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,690
How about we celebrate now ?

399
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,025
I've got to go back to work.

400
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,902
Tomorrow. Breakfast.

401
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,281
Perfect.

402
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,659
So I'm guessing
we got a blood match, huh ?

403
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,995
That's why we're here.

404
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,249
Life vests ?

405
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,252
We can't exactly load up the cart
with axes and machetes, can we ?

406
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,045
Exactly right.

407
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,841
So, um, have you given any thought
as to how you want to do this ?

408
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,052
Mm-hm.
Small-caliber gun to the head.

409
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,637
Coge.

410
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,806
Then I walk away.

411
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,309
- That happens all the time.
- Guns make noise.

412
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,770
And they leave evidence behind -
bullets, casings, powder residue.

413
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,440
- Not to mention the body.
- OK.

414
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,192
You don't want to create a crime scene.

415
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,736
It's where experts like me
gather evidence against you.

416
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,321
OK, OK. I get it, I get it.

417
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,448
What do you suggest ?

418
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,871
Up close and personal.

419
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:45,543
Hey, in case we have
to tie anybody up.

420
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,424
I'm gonna put together
a starter kit for you.

421
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,489
Hey, you're gettin' better.

422
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,491
Yeah, what do you know ?

423
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:28,253
<i>What better place to gamble on Miguel
than a room full of... games of chance ?</i>

424
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,672
Where slot machines go to die, huh ?

425
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,591
And at least one gambler.

426
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,727
I think that's it.

427
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:49,899
- Now we pick up Mr. Fleeter.
- You ever drop a quart of milk ?

428
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,069
Watch it spread over the whole
kitchen floor, the mess it makes ?

429
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,821
Yeah.

430
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,283
There's six quarts of blood in the
human body. This isn't gonna be pretty.

431
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,120
There's no shame in backing out.

432
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:06,499
Dex, after 14 years of filing briefs,

433
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,294
trying cases,
and dealing with bullshit...

434
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,631
this is all gonna look
nice and neat in comparison.

435
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:25,685
I have been to some lame-ass
rubber chicken dinners in my day, OK ?

436
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,771
- I know, I know.
- A no-host bar is punishment enough,

437
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,231
but no bar at all is cruel.

438
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,774
And unusual.

439
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,485
- All right, I'm buying the first round.
- Thank you.

440
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,862
That's pretty.

441
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,488
Gift from my first husband.

442
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,949
Nice, nice.

443
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,951
You're handsome !

444
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,537
Dire ethanol emergency here.

445
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,039
What'll it be, ladies ?

446
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,874
Uh, Cuba libre for this one.

447
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,250
Gracias.

448
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,878
And a double Scotch,
neat soda back, pourmoi.

449
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:53,880
Very nice.

450
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,883
Mm. Huh.

451
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,926
Easy.

452
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:03,723
And who was that guy, that suit and haircut
sitting next to you that wouldn't shut up ?

453
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:09,312
Oh, the, um, the senior liaison
for the Greater Mi... Who knows ?

454
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:13,149
What's sad is that this is the only
social event I've been to in six months.

455
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,234
Oh, that doesn't qualify as a social event.

456
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,946
OK.

457
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,324
Can I get you anything else ?

458
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:27,205
Yeah, how about a foot massage
with those big, gorgeous hands of yours ?

459
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,085
They're kind of cold from scooping ice.

460
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,336
Mm.

461
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,380
Hmm, but you're hot.

462
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,591
Cheers.

463
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,012
- Nothing shy about you, huh ?
- No.

464
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,847
Well...

465
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,850
after a pair of empty marriages,
I realized...

466
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:52,146
the secret to long life
and happiness is...

467
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:56,734
well, chocolate, and flirting with young,
hopefully hung, men.

468
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,405
Sounds fattening and dangerous.

469
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:02,615
- Oh, but so fun.
- Hmm.

470
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,744
- Which clearly, you're not having enough of.
- I am.

471
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,914
Look, believe me, I've had my fun.

472
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,583
You need to be raising hell
and breaking hearts.

473
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,794
- I need to be ?
- You need to be.

474
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,046
The skirt-wearing days
do not last forever.

475
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,215
We all end up old and in the way.

476
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,316
<i>I tell Miguel to be inconspicuous,
and what does he do ?</i>

477
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,319
<i>He shows up
looking like the Unabomber.</i>

478
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:42,530
<i>I've got my work cut out for me.</i>

479
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,616
Oh, close game, close game.

480
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,119
Yeah, good D.

481
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,665
Good game, huh ?

482
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,792
No, it's not a good game.

483
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,503
Good game is when they don't
beat the fucking point spread.

484
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,298
Oh, you got a little money riding on this ?

485
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,218
A little bit.

486
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,771
Shit.

487
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,526
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

488
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,404
Not half as sorry
as somebody else is gonna be.

489
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,658
Here we go.

490
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,414
Buenas noches, patrón.

491
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,168
Hey, who was that guy ?

492
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,295
Uh, I don't know. Some guy.

493
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,215
- How do you know him ?
- I don't.

494
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,467
Dex, sometimes people recognize me.

495
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,512
It's off. We're not doing this.

496
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,682
- We need to take down the kill room.
- No, no, Dex, let's just wait.

497
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,478
No one ever goes in that room there.
You saw. Tranquilo, huh ?

498
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,396
We decide tomorrow, OK ?

499
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,650
We'll see.

500
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:11,285
Anton. Me again.

501
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,538
Waiting on you still.

502
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,042
The way I figured it,
you gigged until closing,

503
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:22,380
then you went home and smoked some of
that herb that you keep in your cereal box.

504
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:25,925
And now, like all self-indulgent,
vaguely adolescent musicians,

505
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,386
you are sleeping in till noon
and I'm OK with that.

506
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,096
OK ? I'm OK with that.

507
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,265
As long as you're alone.

508
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,101
OK, OK. Too much caffeine.

509
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,284
<i>A Dutch farmer sees his crop fail.</i>

510
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,745
<i>No money to his name,
he takes a job working on a boat.</i>

511
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,999
<i>An unseasonably strong wind
blows him to Indonesia.</i>

512
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,334
<i>He drops a bean into the soil.</i>

513
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,671
<i>And voilà, 400 years later...</i>

514
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,464
<i>Java.</i>

515
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,049
<i>Everything is connected.</i>

516
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,014
Hello ?

517
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,309
Dex, wanna hook up for breakfast ?
I'm buying.

518
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,437
I would, Deb,
but I'm already freshly bageled.

519
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,982
- What are you doing up so early ?
- Trying to be a good fiancé.

520
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,651
Rita made me vice president
in charge of wedding rings,

521
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,403
so I'm off to the jewellery store.

522
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:31,073
And what do you know
about buying women jewelry ?

523
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,077
- Zero.
- Less than. Jesus, Dex.

524
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,706
Look, I'll meet you at that place
on 2nd Street at ten o'clock, OK ?

525
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,467
The wedding band has to match the
engagement ring. What does that look like ?

526
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,680
She said she didn't want one.

527
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,099
My God, you just get dumber every day.

528
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,810
How do you survive in this world ?
Of course she wants one.

529
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,063
How am I supposed to know that ?

530
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:05,274
You're such a Y-chromosome cliché.

531
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,695
Just buy her a beautiful, romantic,
"I love you with all of my heart"

532
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,988
fucking engagement ring.

533
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,783
And Dex... size matters.

534
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:24,585
Can I ask you something
non-jewelry-wise ?

535
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,087
Go for it.

536
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,507
OK, hypothetically...

537
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:35,429
Let's say that this guy has to work
with this girl, but he fucking hates doing it,

538
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,723
and too bad cause he has no fucking choice.

539
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,892
And ?

540
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,688
And one thing leads to another...

541
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,899
and this hypothetical guy...

542
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:51,237
starts having sex
with this hypothetical girl.

543
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,822
Hypothetical sex ?

544
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,074
Real sex.

545
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:57,827
Really real sex.

546
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,413
But then the guy is told
he no longer has to work with this girl,

547
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:05,042
and poof ! He just disappears.
You know, thin air. Adiós.

548
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,585
So I'm wondering,

549
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:10,172
is it possible Mr. Hypothetical
never really was all that into this girl ?

550
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,134
And he was just getting it on
to, I don't know, pass the time

551
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,846
or satisfy primal urges or whatever ?

552
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,724
Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

553
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,727
What the fuck do you know ?

554
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:30,568
That one. I gotta go sit
in a hot car and wait for a suspect.

555
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,909
Hey, Anton.

556
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,036
What the fuck ? Call me.

557
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,137
I can bring Mario in myself.

558
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,599
Let you get all the credit for catching
the Skinner ? No fucking way.

559
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,935
- We don't know he's the Skinner.
- Closest thing we got.

560
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,275
That was really fucking unfair
what you said yesterday.

561
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,404
Well, is it true ?

562
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,407
That a cop died because of you ?

563
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,661
- It's not that simple.
- Try me.

564
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,833
Yuki Amado was my partner
in Narcotics.

565
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,961
There was another detective
on our team, Stewart.

566
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,882
He made a bad judgment call
and shot an unarmed coke dealer.

567
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,135
I remember that.

568
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,807
Paralyzed him, right ?

569
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,561
Then Stewart went on a bender
until he finally swallowed his own bullet.

570
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,189
How does Yuki make that your fault ?

571
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:54,235
Because Stewart had a problem
with crystal meth.

572
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,320
And I knew it.

573
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,283
And rather than bust him,
I tried to protect him.

574
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,078
So it is your fault.

575
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,747
Listen to you.
Everything is so black and white.

576
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,708
- You could have stopped him.
- Sure, if I knew what I knew now.

577
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,878
- But that's not the way things work.
- I'm sorry, you're just making excuses.

578
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,922
Of course I'm making excuses.

579
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,049
Don't you ? How else do you sleep at night ?

580
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,468
Who the fuck said I sleep at night ?

581
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,180
Then you must be killing yourself
over hooking up with Anton, huh ?

582
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,895
Yeah, It was probably a mistake. I think he
lost interest once he realized he was free.

583
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,565
Not so black and white, is it ?

584
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,238
Mario.

585
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,247
Mario Astorga ?

586
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,543
- Fuck !
- Fuck.

587
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,808
I'm guessing he didn't want
to come in for questioning.

588
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,145
- He made a run for it.
- Interview Two.

589
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,940
- What's his story ?
- So far, he hasn't said a word.

590
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,778
Ah, you keep at it. And you check
with Nicaraguan authorities on priors.

591
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,365
- We're just waiting to hear back.
- Qué jodienda.

592
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,950
I'm never gonna get out of here.

593
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,370
I gotta call Barbara
and cancel our dinner.

594
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,624
Oh, she's not gonna like that.

595
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,417
I mean, it-it's work.

596
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,463
I'm not here.
Leave a message.

597
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,214
Hello, Barbara.

598
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:44,136
This is, uh, Sergeant Angel Batista.

599
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,180
Angel to you.

600
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,973
How are you ?

601
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,100
Good, I hope.

602
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:54,897
So I have to cancel our dinner tonight.

603
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:59,652
And I am deeply, deeply apologetic.

604
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,489
And I hope that you will
let me make it up to you

605
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,659
in whatever possible way

606
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:11,205
you wish things made up to you... in.

607
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,679
Oh, I can tell by that look on your face,

608
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,349
you're trying to figure out how to tell me
something I don't wanna hear.

609
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,814
Calling off the kill.

610
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,941
- It's over.
- Really, Dex ?

611
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,404
Just because some guy
recognized me in a bar ?

612
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,324
No one is ever gonna make that connection
once Fleeter disappears.

613
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,576
I'm not taking that chance.

614
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,537
That's not the way you do things, right ?

615
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,330
No, it isn't.

616
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:58,043
- Tell me about that.
- What are you asking ?

617
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,131
I wasn't gonna bring it up before
but I'm guessing...

618
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,216
you've been doing this for a while.

619
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,386
Freebo wasn't your first.

620
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,346
Was he ?

621
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,686
How many, Dex ?

622
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:20,190
OK, you know what, it doesn't matter.

623
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,152
I will respect your privacy.

624
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,324
But I just don't understand,
why are you not gonna help me here ?

625
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,703
Just because we broke
this little rule from your code ?

626
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,580
Come on, Dex. It's OK !

627
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,624
No, it's not OK !

628
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:44,089
You never should have
asked me to help you. You're not ready.

629
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,133
I'm not... ? Or is it you that's not ready ?

630
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:50,220
Huh ? Because we could have dealt with this
Fleeter problem like three times already

631
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:53,348
and you keep throwing up these roadblocks
with all this code bullshit.

632
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:56,769
- It's not bullshit.
- Keep telling yourself that, Dex.

633
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,188
It's like wearing a fucking straitjacket, man.

634
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,941
No, Miguel, it's just the opposite.

635
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:06,570
If I didn't have the code, the darkness...

636
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:24,213
I could stand here and tell you
another story about my abusive father,

637
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,424
but what I haven't told you about is that time
that I kicked the shit out of him

638
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,928
and knocked him down a flight of stairs.
And I really enjoyed it.

639
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:38,477
That was the first time in my life
that I've ever felt...

640
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,687
powerful, like...

641
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,442
like I was in control of-of something.

642
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,530
And ever since then, I've been trying
to get that feeling back again.

643
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:56,745
So when you talk to me about...
the darkness inside of you...

644
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,457
I understand.

645
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,128
I really do.

646
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,217
I just want to let some of mine out too.

647
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,143
I know you understand that.

648
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:30,529
You know what, Mr. Astorga ?
Maybe I should have opened with my closer.

649
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,531
Meaning ?

650
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:37,536
We know about the incident in Managua,
the one where you stabbed a cab driver.

651
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,206
He touched my sister.
Sadly, he survived.

652
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,667
That's a heartbreaking story !

653
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:48,338
- Still you are an illegal guest of our country.
- Immigration's on the way.

654
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,090
You're gonna be on a plane
before the sun comes up.

655
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,800
But I have a son.

656
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,053
He was born here. He's a US citizen.
He's my life.

657
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,556
- Your boy's a US citizen ?
- Yes.

658
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,434
Then he stays. Maybe your wife too.
We don't know yet.

659
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,145
We do know if you keep stonewalling us
on this Skinner case,

660
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,688
you are gone on a one-way ticket.

661
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:09,067
No matter what you try to do to me,
the facts ain't changing.

662
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,153
I don't know anything about anything.

663
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,198
Then why would George King
suggest otherwise ?

664
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,830
Señor King said I knew something ?

665
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:25,792
In a word ? Yup.

666
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:34,218
And Señor King will be very disappointed
to hear you're calling him a liar.

667
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,928
No !

668
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:37,137
Please.

669
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,308
What are you so afraid of, Mario ?

670
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:45,479
- Yeah, what'd this guy do to you ?
- What can he do to you ?

671
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,731
Please.

672
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,442
Send me back to Nicaragua.

673
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,612
- Alone ?
- Si. Yes.

674
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,072
Alone.

675
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,833
We mentioned George King's name
once and he turns to jello.

676
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,335
Scared to death of him.

677
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,545
- You thinking what I'm thinking ?
- Yeah, King jobbed us.

678
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,923
I'm gonna issue a BOLO for him.

679
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,271
Hello ?

680
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:28,438
Shit.

681
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,151
Who was it ?

682
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,319
Uh, me.

683
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,614
I was checking to see
if my phone was working.

684
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,160
Barbara never called me back.

685
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,787
I think I ruined it.

686
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:46,707
Sorry.

687
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,959
Dating sucks.

688
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,128
Yeah.

689
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:58,135
Well, I'm outta here. Still no George King,
but we put the word out.

690
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,607
Barbara.

691
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,321
Mm.

692
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,239
You got my message.

693
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,409
Yup. Been listening to it all day.

694
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,996
Makes me laugh every time.

695
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,292
- It's pretty bad, huh ?
- Um, the worst.

696
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:37,007
- I'm glad I amuse you.
- Not half as glad as I am.

697
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,562
Hey, did they finish already ?

698
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,439
They never even started.

699
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,816
What do you mean ?
Where's Anton ?

700
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,109
He never showed.

701
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,736
- Why ?
- I don't know.

702
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,822
They waited an hour. They called.
Doesn't answer.

703
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,784
Thanks.

704
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,421
Oye, chiquitico.

705
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,257
What the f...

706
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,734
Poetic.

707
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,327
Are you ready ?

708
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:49,871
I am.

709
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,129
Thank you.

710
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,298
Thank you for this.

711
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,551
For letting me in.

712
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,430
For showing me the way.

713
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,825
Look at him.

714
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,581
Look at him trying to figure it all out.

715
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,416
What the fuck ?

716
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,919
We're here because of them.

717
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:42,174
Those lives that you destroyed.

718
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:45,635
Who are you ?

719
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,598
We're justice.

720
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,231
Hey, man, I was just doing
what I had to do.

721
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,608
As are we.

722
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,117
<i>I've always done the deed alone.</i>

723
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:11,453
<i>Never stood outside,</i>

724
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,039
<i>been a witness to this moment.</i>

725
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,795
<i>The moment of truth.</i>

726
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,964
<i>Can Miguel go through with it ?</i>

727
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,509
<i>Can he step out of the cocoon and fly ?</i>

728
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:07,842
How do you feel ?

729
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,271
Fantastic.

730
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,949
Shouldn't we get him out of here ?

731
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,703
<i>As bonded as we may feel,</i>

732
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,997
<i>there are still things
I can't share with Miguel.</i>

733
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,123
I got it.

734
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:42,335
No, it's... it's too much work.

735
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,046
Leaving no trace is my area of expertise.

736
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,174
Yeah, but, Dex...

737
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:51,261
Get home before Sylvia
starts to wonder where you are.

738
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,054
I mean it.

739
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,681
OK.

740
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,308
I'm going.

741
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,648
Not a good idea.

742
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,447
That would be against your code, huh ?

743
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,866
Sorry.

744
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,843
Anton, you in there ?

745
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,270
Hello, Anton ?

746
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:05,502
Oh, God.

747
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,805
Shit. Trimmed trees.
The Skinner's been here.

748
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:37,534
You were wrong. It went well.

749
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,120
Maybe. Who knows ?

750
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:43,540
You can't admit it. He did good.

751
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,542
That was never the issue, Dex.

752
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,795
I was only thinking about you.

753
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,964
Of course.

754
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,384
You've set something in motion here.

755
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,970
Everything Miguel does from now on
is connected to you.

756
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:01,516
It's a lot of responsibility,
teaching him what you just did.

757
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,435
A heavy burden.

758
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:09,107
It was too much for me to bear.
I hope you're a stronger man.

759
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,891
Hey.

760
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,436
You're still up.

761
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,607
I can't sleep.

762
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:10,710
I hope it's OK.

763
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,338
My God.

764
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,216
It's... It's perfect.

765
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,843
Oh.

766
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,764
Dexter, God, you've been
such a saint through all this.

767
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,183
I don't know how you've put up with me.

768
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,187
If you need me to help out
with more of the wedding stuff...

769
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,356
No. No, it's...

770
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,735
It's the hormones.

771
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,987
I go crazy when I'm pregnant.

772
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,073
Tell me about it.

773
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,366
That's not true.

774
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:45,912
You should just get out while you can.
Just run for your life.

775
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:48,748
I won't.

776
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,667
I promise.

777
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,504
It's like I have this monster
living inside of me,

778
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,339
and I don't know how to control it.

779
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,179
Maybe I can help you out with that one.

780
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,733
It's so beautiful.

781
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:24,617
<i>It's been said that a butterfly
can flap its wings in Brazil...</i>

782
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,622
<i>and set off a storm in Florida.</i>

783
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:37,046
<i>I'm taking the chance
that's not entirely true.</i>
