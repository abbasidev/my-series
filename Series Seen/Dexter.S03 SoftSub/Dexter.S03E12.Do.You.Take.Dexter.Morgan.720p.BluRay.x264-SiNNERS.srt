1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:03,419
<i>Previously on Dexter.</i>

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,798
<i>I can honestly say I know
who Miguel Prado really is.</i>

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,132
<i>My first good friend.</i>

4
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,967
We need to go after
the root cause.

5
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:13,304
Blood-sucking, soulless
defense attorney Ellen Wolf !

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,431
Walk in the park
to discredit you, Counselor.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,808
- Try it.
- Oh, I'm not the one on trial.

8
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,643
- Oh, you should be.
- You should be !

9
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,937
This is personal.
Fuck yes, this is personal.

10
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,480
And it should be personal for you too.

11
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,649
As my friend.
I'm asking you to do this for me.

12
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,317
- Sorry, no.
- Well, then fuck you !

13
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,153
Miguel went missing last night.
Ellen's missing this morning.

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,614
I hope she didn't get
in an accident or something.

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,158
<i>He did it. Miguel really did it.</i>

16
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,660
Wow. I didn't get it before, Miguel,

17
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,913
but you can't be reasoned with,
guilted, controlled.

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,916
This whole back-and-forth game
for leverage is pointless.

19
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,128
That's right ! I'll do what I want,
when I want,

20
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,381
to whomever I want ! Count on it !

21
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,550
Yes, we will marry you.

22
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,135
You should be my best man.

23
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,054
- What ?
- I trust you more than anyone.

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,307
Why are you running your mouth about
family business to a goddamn stranger ?

25
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,059
Dexter is not the problem here.

26
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,853
Better keep your fucking
hands off of me, pendejo.

27
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,104
<i>Ellen Wolf's ring.</i>

28
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,481
Ellen Wolf was threatening
to wreck his career.

29
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,818
He has a black SUV and no alibi
for the night she died.

30
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,903
You think Miguel had something
to do with her murder ?

31
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,823
I found this sample
in the back of his car.

32
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,701
<i>While LaGuerta's deciding,
I'll be eliminating her problem.</i>

33
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,578
<i>And George King's going to help me.</i>

34
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,873
<i>I'll copy his MO. They won't even look
for another suspect.</i>

35
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,959
I am this close to getting my shield,
and I'm putting it all at risk to be with you !

36
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,043
Then, Debra, why are you ?!

37
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,005
I need for you
to seriously think about us.

38
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,883
You've had a bug up your ass
about Dad for months now.

39
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,093
He didn't cheat on Mom.

40
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,597
- Bullshit. Who ?
- A CI.

41
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,893
Laura Moser. My mother.

42
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,977
I kinda need a favor.

43
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,687
That's what I'm here for.
What do you need ?

44
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,064
All the records you have on my
dad's confidential informants.

45
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,941
The Skinner. George King.

46
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,652
The Nicaraguan embassy
is still giving me the run-around.

47
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,572
Until we know King's true identity,
there's not much to go on.

48
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:58,326
You need to have a long conversation
with Dexter Morgan.

49
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:01,704
You think I'm done with you ?
You think this ends here ?

50
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,748
It doesn't !

51
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:04,999
It does for you.

52
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,212
<i>There are few milestones in life</i>

53
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,091
<i>that evoke a stronger response
than our final act.</i>

54
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,718
<i>Death.</i>

55
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,931
<i>What was once moving, speaking,
killing and threatening</i>

56
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,559
<i>becomes nothing
but an empty vessel,</i>

57
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,396
<i>which is not so different
from how I've always felt.</i>

58
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:17,566
Several patches of skin
removed from the, uh, shoulder area.

59
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,485
Ligature marks on the neck.

60
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,738
Why the fuck would the Skinner
wanna kill Miguel Prado ?

61
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,448
Miguel was after Freebo.

62
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,784
King had to figure
he knew something.

63
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,540
<i>We all react
in different ways to death.</i>

64
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,668
<i>Some, like Ramon, choose anger.</i>

65
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,254
<i>Others cling to ritual.</i>

66
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,759
Dex, I know he was your friend,

67
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,471
so if you wanna
take a pass on this...

68
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,265
Nah, that's all right. I got it.

69
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:53,769
<i>Me, I'll play the grieving friend
who buries himself in his work.</i>

70
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:11,746
<i>You can tell a lot about a person
by the friends he keeps.</i>

71
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,502
<i>And this is my best friend.</i>

72
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,013
<i>Goodbye, Miguel.</i>

73
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,184
Don't fucking
touch my brother.

74
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,311
Let go of my arm.

75
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,565
Now.

76
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,317
Come here.

77
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,739
I am going to find out
why this happened.

78
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,824
We all want the same thing, Ramon.

79
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,512
That was awkward.

80
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,182
I don't think I've ever been
asked to leave a funeral before.

81
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,519
Ramon didn't ask you to leave.
He pushed you out the door.

82
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,270
Yeah, he was drunk.

83
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,523
I could smell the fumes.

84
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,733
He's just so angry.

85
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,902
He's lost two brothers.

86
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,071
He doesn't know who to blame.

87
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,781
Well, certainly not you.

88
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,534
<i>No, certainly not me.</i>

89
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,744
Hey.

90
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,122
How you handling this ?

91
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,043
Oh, you know,
a lot of different emotions.

92
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,588
I know Miguel wasn't
the man you thought he was.

93
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,173
But you lost a friend.

94
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,385
You don't have to be so strong.

95
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,512
Can't help it.

96
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,558
Oh, poor Syl.

97
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,770
- She has so much to deal with.
- I can only imagine.

98
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,481
She insists we go through
with the wedding. She still wants to come

99
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,608
- to the rehearsal dinner tomorrow night.
- Yeah...

100
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,069
life goes on.

101
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,950
From your mother ?

102
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,161
Mm. She's not coming down.

103
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,497
She started teaching again
and can't miss class.

104
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,209
- Too bad.
- That's my loving mother.

105
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,923
"Let's hope the third one's the charm."
What's that mean ?

106
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,302
Mm.

107
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,095
The kid.

108
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,347
The third kid is the charm.

109
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,809
Cody and Astor are charms too.

110
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,770
Like I said, that's my loving mother.

111
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,607
<i>Did Rita just lie to me ?</i>

112
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,610
So have you written your vows yet ?

113
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,613
Not completely.

114
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,283
What should I say ?

115
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,037
Well, you can talk
about togetherness,

116
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,290
loyalty, attraction, honesty.

117
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,793
Honesty. Right.

118
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,507
You know, I should get home
and keep working on them.

119
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,510
Mm. You should keep that.

120
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,809
He gave me so much.

121
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,689
<i>Darling Rita,
once you were a dream and a prayer.</i>

122
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:30,069
<i>Now our future is as bright as the sun
glinting off the morning dew.</i>

123
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,238
<i>And I vow that I will...</i>

124
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,282
<i>Sounds like I'm marrying a unicorn.</i>

125
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,313
Excuse me, sir. You the occupant ?

126
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,440
- Yeah.
- Detective Pratt.

127
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,443
Property manager called us.
They found your door open.

128
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,861
Yeah, he called me too.

129
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,115
We're gonna need you to take a good
look around and see what's missing.

130
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,120
It's kinda hard to tell.

131
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,746
Your neighbor, a Ms. Levin,

132
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,873
saw someone hanging
around the mailboxes.

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,876
Latin, kinda burly, goatee.
Ring any bells ?

134
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,587
<i>Ramon Prado.</i>

135
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,298
No.

136
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,024
Thanks. Let me know
if you find out anything.

137
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,067
You got it. Thank you.

138
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,882
Miguel warned you that his death
wasn't gonna be the end of things.

139
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:19,386
So his plan was to make me
hire a housekeeper ?

140
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,434
Your suit for the wedding.
That's personal.

141
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:32,358
Ramon Prado's
like a gut-shot animal.

142
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,568
You know what to do
with a wounded animal.

143
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,113
You put it out of its misery.

144
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,660
I can't kill him.
He doesn't meet the code.

145
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,497
Can't kill him.

146
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,040
Can't ignore him.

147
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,802
I have no intention of ignoring him.

148
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,644
<i>I can use the ring
to tie Miguel to Ellen Wolf's murder,</i>

149
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,898
<i>threaten to destroy Ramon's
sainted brother's reputation forever.</i>

150
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:16,193
<i>That's enough
to get Ramon to back down.</i>

151
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,113
Sara.

152
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,115
Dexter ?

153
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,410
How are you ?

154
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,078
Honestly, not so great.

155
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,206
I'm sorry, is... is Ramon in ?

156
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,584
No. He didn't come home with us
from the funeral.

157
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,711
Doesn't answer his cell.

158
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,673
He's been on a bender, Dexter.
I have no idea where he is.

159
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,716
Oh.

160
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,094
I'm really worried about him.

161
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,389
If you hear from him,
will you let him know I stopped by ?

162
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,275
<i>Ramon's blood family
doesn't know where he is.</i>

163
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,237
<i>Maybe his blue family does.</i>

164
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,911
Morning. Sheriff's Department.

165
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,081
Yeah, could you put me through
to Sergeant Jessie Whitaker, please ?

166
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,374
One moment, please.

167
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,592
Gail Brandon.
Future mother-in-law.

168
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:26,054
<i>While I'm waiting, I may as well
check into my new partner.</i>

169
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,101
Sergeant Whitaker's in the field.
Would you like to leave a message ?

170
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,146
Uh, this is sort of important.
I'm with Miami Metro Homicide.

171
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,274
- You think you can track him down ?
- Please hold.

172
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,613
<i>Before she left Michigan,
Rita Bennett would have been</i>

173
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>Rita... Brandon.</i>

174
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,205
<i>Ackerman.</i>

175
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,582
<i>Paul Bennett
wasn't her first husband.</i>

176
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:57,044
<i>She was married before, at 16.</i>

177
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:03,467
<i>Ending in a divorce six months later.
An impetuous teen marriage.</i>

178
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,803
<i>Which makes me her third husband.</i>

179
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,139
<i>The charm.</i>

180
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,643
The brass is giving us a blank check
as far as overtime is concerned

181
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,603
until this man is in custody.

182
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,355
Jorge Orozco.

183
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,690
AKA George King.

184
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,778
Affectionately known back home
as el Fierro, the Blade.

185
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,822
Orozco was a captain
in the Resistencia Nicaragüense.

186
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,076
The Contras.
He headed an interrogation unit.

187
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,203
He tortured people for a living.

188
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,666
And killed them.

189
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,252
Now this already was a big case.

190
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:44,675
With Miguel Prado's murder,
it's officially huge.

191
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,178
This is Whitaker.

192
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:53,600
Hi, my name is Dexter Morgan. I'm trying to
track down your old partner Ramon Prado.

193
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,352
Why ?

194
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,688
I'm a family friend.

195
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,274
Sara told me he's been missing
since his brother's funeral.

196
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,110
I figured with his problem and all...

197
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,445
Gotcha.

198
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,031
Actually, I haven't seen him
since he left.

199
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,701
I know a few places
he used to hang out at.

200
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,161
I mean, basically any bar
within a ten-mile radius.

201
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,622
I can give you a few
of his favorites, if you like.

202
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,541
I'm sure Sara would appreciate that.

203
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,835
Yeah, I'm sure.

204
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,422
<i>I'd love to help them
with George King,</i>

205
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:27,301
<i>but I've got a more pressing
situation to deal with -</i>

206
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,553
<i>Miguel's wounded messenger.</i>

207
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,056
Morgan... a minute ?

208
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,434
Sure, Sarge.

209
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,734
So it took a couple of months
and a lot of wrangling,

210
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,861
but my budget request
finally came through.

211
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,822
Homicide is gonna get
a little extra money.

212
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,992
Oh, that's great. We should get
one of those crime-sight imagers.

213
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,077
Have you seen 'em ?
Their pictures are amazing.

214
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,662
Really ?

215
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,914
I mean, that's what you'd spend it on ?

216
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,293
Cause I was thinking maybe we'd spend it
on adding another detective to our squad.

217
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,086
Oh.

218
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,383
Maybe somebody
who saved the life of a CI

219
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,677
who ID'd our Skinner.

220
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,181
Ohh.

221
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,266
Uh...

222
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,270
I don't know what to say,
I mean, wow.

223
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,605
Thank you.

224
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,608
I put in the recommendation
to Lieutenant LaGuerta.

225
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,318
She's just gotta sign the paperwork.

226
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,071
Oh, fuck.
Thank you, thank you.

227
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,282
We could use a little joy around here.
Good work.

228
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,242
Thank you.

229
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,627
I got it.

230
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,545
I'm guessing "it"
is something good ?

231
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,172
My detective shield.

232
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,299
Oh, big news.

233
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,678
It's gigantic news. All LaGuerta has to do
is sign the papers and I'm golden.

234
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,262
Well, I'm silver.

235
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,848
- We should celebrate.
- Yeah, come on.

236
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,768
I mean later. I gotta pick up the kids,
go to the tailor's...

237
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,311
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

238
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,439
You know, Dad would be proud.

239
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,195
That still means something,
no matter how flawed he was.

240
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,823
Yeah, look at us.

241
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,825
You're getting married.

242
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,703
I'm making detective.

243
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,832
The Morgans
are gonna be all right.

244
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,127
- I'll see you at the rehearsal dinner.
- OK.

245
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,633
Yo, Frances.

246
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,595
Any progress
on my dad's CI files ?

247
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,098
Ooh, he knew a lot of folks,
I'll give him that.

248
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,307
Anyone of interest ?

249
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,893
I haven't culled through everything yet.

250
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,314
Are you sure you want me to ?
Some things are better left in a box.

251
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,108
I just...

252
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,486
I need to put a face on her.

253
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,698
Knowing all the details
isn't gonna change the fact

254
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,534
that he was messing around on the sly.

255
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,203
I know.

256
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,456
I'll send 'em up as soon as I can.

257
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,332
Thank you, Frances.

258
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,506
Dexter. I need a word.

259
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,891
The city council has voted
to name the freeway interchange

260
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,976
near my house after Miguel Prado.

261
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,438
I drive that way every single day.

262
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,316
He was a hero.

263
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,609
To some.

264
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,402
He was a cold-blooded killer.

265
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,030
He murdered my friend,
and now he's got an interchange ?

266
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,242
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

267
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,455
But you're the only other person
who knows the truth.

268
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,919
Maybe it's time
we let others in on the secret.

269
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,547
There is nothing to link Miguel
to Ellen Wolf's murder

270
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,509
except evidence that was obtained
illegally, and therefore inadmissible.

271
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,762
I'll find something.
I'll tear his life apart if I have to.

272
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,516
He doesn't have a life any more.
It's his family you'd have to tear apart.

273
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,893
The community.
The Cuban community.

274
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,897
And you still might not be able
to prove anything.

275
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,819
So I just keep it a secret.

276
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,658
I hate secrets.

277
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,034
We all have them.

278
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,205
Well, then tell me, Dexter.

279
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,917
How am I supposed
to live with this ?

280
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,631
You just do.

281
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,426
Can I get an everything burrito
and a side of beans,

282
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,387
maybe a little bit of...

283
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,722
Anton.

284
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,224
- Hey.
- Hi.

285
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,767
- You're here.
- Yeah.

286
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,894
Yeah, I was just, um, picking up
some things from evidence.

287
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,437
My wallet, watch, chapstick.

288
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,482
- I could've brought that to you.
- No, it's cool. It's cool, I got it.

289
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,611
- So how you doing ?
- I'm all right.

290
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,822
- Good.
- Oh, but...

291
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,824
Looks like I'm gonna get
my detective shield.

292
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,578
- Debra, wow, that's great. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

293
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,329
That's good. That's good.

294
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,622
- You wanna get some co...
- I should probably go.

295
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,165
OK.

296
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,586
- I'll see ya.
- I'll see you.

297
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,265
<i>I stopped at four bars,
got a new appreciation</i>

298
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,143
<i>for how many alcoholics
there are in Miami.</i>

299
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,270
<i>But still no Ramon.</i>

300
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,449
Morgan.

301
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,200
What's up ?

302
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:53,043
I just found out from the ADA's office
that they're requesting logs

303
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,170
from the Anton Briggs
surveillance detail.

304
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,632
Now, I didn't know why
until I read 'em.

305
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,510
You slept with our key witness ?

306
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:07,265
- The ADA's looking into it ?
- Miguel Prado was.

307
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,895
I don't know what the status
of it is now, but it's a conflict,

308
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:14,356
and you should have
given me the heads up.

309
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,736
Especially before I sent my recommendation
to LaGuerta for your shield.

310
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,031
- You're gonna spike it now ?
- LaGuerta has final say.

311
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,742
But she deserves full disclosure.

312
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,496
Disclosure ? Really, Sarge ?

313
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:33,792
Did you disclose that you met Gianna
because you were out strolling for a hooker ?

314
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,588
- Where did you hear that ?
- I...

315
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,093
- Where'd you hear that ?
- I know someone in Vice.

316
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:46,596
I'm the only one that knows, I think.
It's not even that big of a deal.

317
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,058
Fuck, fuck ! I am sorry. I'm sorry.

318
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,815
It's just my chickens
coming home to roost.

319
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,737
Oh, fuck, fuck.

320
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,959
I met Detective Gianna
while seeking the comfort of prostitutes.

321
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,335
Excuse me ?

322
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,462
I propositioned her.

323
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,965
She revealed to me to be police.

324
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,384
She had mercy on me.
She let me off with a warning.

325
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,636
It was a dark time for me.

326
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,764
I completely understand
if you wanna pursue a case against me.

327
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,600
As cases go,

328
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:35,937
laying you out for thinking with your dick
is pretty low on my list of priorities.

329
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,690
Actually, I was looking
for simple human connection.

330
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,776
No. Right.

331
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,445
You're right.

332
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,323
We all have secrets
we prefer not to share, Angel.

333
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,034
Skeletons.

334
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,581
Feel free to keep yours in the closet.
Deep in the closet.

335
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,541
- Thanks, Maria.
- Mm-hm.

336
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,504
There's something else you should hear
from me instead of the grapevine.

337
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,007
Angel, how dark of a time was this ?

338
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,677
It's regarding my recommendation
of Debra Morgan for detective.

339
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,950
So, when you and mom
get married, what should we call you ?

340
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,953
Um, I think Mr. Handsome
would be a good name.

341
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,461
<i>Is that you, Ramon ?</i>

342
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,588
Uh, you can call me whatever you want.

343
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,382
I think we'll just call you Dexter.

344
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,593
That sounds good.

345
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,934
<i>Following me with kids in my car ?</i>

346
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,019
<i>Now you're just pissing me off.</i>

347
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,900
<i>Moment of truth.</i>

348
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,070
<i>Stop or get a ticket, asshole.</i>

349
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,911
Did you see that, Dexter ?

350
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,373
Yeah, that's what happens
when drivers do stupid things.

351
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,137
Looks like he's OK enough
to walk away.

352
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,766
<i>Until I get a hold of him.</i>

353
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,686
This is gonna be a nice dinner.

354
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,771
Thank you for doing this, Dexter.

355
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,941
Just doing what grooms
are supposed to do.

356
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,777
So how are you coming along
with your vows ?

357
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,821
Still working on 'em.

358
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,948
<i>I'm going to lob this in nice and easy.</i>

359
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,325
What kind of vows did you do
the first time around ?

360
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,661
The first time ?

361
00:24:56,787 --> 00:25:00,039
Well, Paul and I just recited
whatever the pastor said.

362
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,792
<i>Liar, liar, pants on fire.</i>

363
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,211
Maitre d' said we'd be seated
in 15 minutes.

364
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,388
Un-fucking-believable.

365
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,600
Ramon, why don't we go outside
and talk about this ?

366
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,727
Fuck you. You don't tell me what to do.

367
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,854
Look, these people
have nothing to do with this.

368
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,064
This is between you and me, right ?

369
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,902
I should put a bullet in your head.
In front of everybody.

370
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,197
So they can see
what it's like to lose someone.

371
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,495
Ramon. Come on, you need to put
the gun down before anyone gets hurt.

372
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,872
Freeze, asshole.

373
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,999
Ohh ! Aah !

374
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,294
Ohh ! Uhh ! Get your hands off of me !

375
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,256
I will, as soon as I get
some of your sheriff buddies down here !

376
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,931
Thank you.

377
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,100
They all say the same thing.

378
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,395
"King was a very polite gardener.
I can't believe he's the Skinner."

379
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,522
I hate polite killers.

380
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,234
I heard you took down
Ramon Prado last night. Again.

381
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,736
Yeah, the Prados must love me.

382
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:13,571
Morgan.

383
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,156
You gonna eat that ?

384
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,741
Not any more, thanks.

385
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,618
That was Robbery.

386
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,537
There was a hit-and-run
fender bender involving a stolen car.

387
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:24,332
Traffic enforcement caught
the guy's face. Guess who.

388
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,877
They're sending a photo over right now.

389
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,760
George fucking King.
God, that's definitely him.

390
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,595
Robbery's sending the car in right now.

391
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,764
I'll grab my kit.
We'll tear that car apart.

392
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,454
By the book, Mr. Morgan.

393
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,666
If you need us,
we're right outside, Lieutenant.

394
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,584
Thanks.

395
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,299
- How's it feel, Ramon ?
- How the fuck does what feel ?

396
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,884
Wake up sober
for the first time in a week.

397
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,137
- Like shit.
- Yeah, that shit's called reality.

398
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,306
It's gonna be life
as you know it for a long time.

399
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,267
I'm gonna be outta here
in a couple of days.

400
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,983
One last coupon from your
famous brother's reputation.

401
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,276
Something like that.

402
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,820
So you don't really have to bother
with reality. That must be nice.

403
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,448
You know what
my fucking reality is ?

404
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,075
Miguel takes me on as a bodyguard,
and I ask him why.

405
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,286
You know what he says ?

406
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:46,748
To protect him from you.

407
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,585
Did he say why ?

408
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,295
No.

409
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,050
The only one Miguel needed
protection from was himself.

410
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,968
- Hmm.
- The man was paranoid.

411
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,970
- That's not true.
- That's true.

412
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,931
You know it as well as I do.

413
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,684
Look, I spent a lot of time
with your brother, but it wasn't 24/7.

414
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,314
I don't know what he was up to
when I wasn't around.

415
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,107
Neither does Syl, neither do you.

416
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,572
What I do know is this.

417
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,036
You got a really ugly history.

418
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,789
Kidnapping, brutality, abuse.

419
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,541
You trashed my apartment.
You followed me.

420
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,919
You put a gun in my face
in front of my friends,

421
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,922
in front of my pregnant fiancée.

422
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:39,634
- Why, Ramon ? What's your endgame ?
- To hurt you.

423
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:44,847
Until you came into our life,
everything was fine.

424
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,101
Fine like what ?
Like Oscar's drug problem ?

425
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,686
Like Miguel's... darkness ?

426
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,692
What do you know about that ?

427
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,946
We were close, Miguel and I.
He told me things.

428
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,283
He told me how he pushed
your father down the stairs

429
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,244
to protect Oscar and you.

430
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,997
And that he enjoyed it.

431
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,043
He fucking told you that ?

432
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,964
It was me that did that to our father.

433
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:23,344
Miguel took it from me,
made it his story.

434
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,389
Part of his goddamn legend.

435
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,477
Miguel always had to be the star.

436
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,522
He got the looks,
the charm, maybe even the brains,

437
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:37,108
but I got the strength.

438
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,902
I spent my whole life
trying to hold it together,

439
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,280
and now it's all gone to shit.

440
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,576
- It doesn't have to.
- Bullshit.

441
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:51,581
Those cases you're talking about,
the kidnapping, the brutality...

442
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,208
that was me sweeping up
after Miguel's fuck-ups.

443
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:02,133
He wasn't making my problems go away.
I was risking my ass to cover his.

444
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,761
Hey, I know the frustration,
the disappointment

445
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,806
of wanting to help your brother
and not being able to.

446
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,940
Where's your son right now ?

447
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,776
Soccer practice.

448
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:22,570
Your daughter ?

449
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,950
Preschool.

450
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,952
Where do they think their father is ?

451
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,623
Sara told them something.

452
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,416
I... I don't know.

453
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,588
Someday your kids will be old enough
to see the truth for themselves,

454
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,549
just like you did with your father.

455
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,511
I know. I've been there.

456
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,765
The sins of the father
go on and on,

457
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,934
from kid to kid to kid,

458
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,853
unless someone - you -

459
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,483
...chooses to end them.

460
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,702
I've been there too.

461
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,668
<i>You don't always have to destroy
a wounded animal.</i>

462
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,630
<i>Sometimes you just
remove the thorn.</i>

463
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,842
Those dark lines...

464
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,302
reticulated veins.

465
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,346
Oh, holy shit, it is skin.

466
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,932
No, more like...

467
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,643
- more like leaf.
- So the only evidence we got

468
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,145
from the car that Skinner stole
is a friggin' leaf ?

469
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:39,897
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

470
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,317
Yep. Tobacco leaf.

471
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,280
Tobacco ?

472
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,241
Fucking A, wasn't there a...

473
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,952
King's, uh, former employer,
what was the name ?

474
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,079
Thank you, Vince.
You're welcome.

475
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,415
Cigar company.
What was it called ?

476
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,708
Uh...

477
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,587
El Royale Cigar Company.

478
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:06,841
It's listed on the first tax form filled out
by King in 1992. Come on, let's go.

479
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,601
- What do you think ?
- It's great.

480
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,102
Thanks for doing this so fast, Bruno.

481
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,063
Happy to help. Now, you do that.

482
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,024
- OK.
- And I'll get your shoes.

483
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,869
Remember what I taught you ?

484
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,871
How could I forget ?

485
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,040
Mom's funeral.

486
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:43,461
The rabbit hops over the log.

487
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,965
Your mother would be so proud.

488
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,134
Both of them.

489
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,138
The rabbit crawls under the log.

490
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,767
The rabbit runs
around the log.

491
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:01,812
One more time, because he's trying
to outsmart the fox.

492
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,940
The rabbit...

493
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:08,903
dives through his rabbit hole.

494
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,490
Safe and sound.

495
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,912
Safe and sound.

496
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,915
Safe and sound.

497
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,757
- What's this ?
- All we got out of the cigar factory.

498
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,426
- It was a total waste of time.
- No sign of King ?

499
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:36,222
The security guard's there round the clock.
No way King gets in or out.

500
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,230
<i>Tomorrow is my wedding day.</i>

501
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,358
<i>Some men would be excited.</i>

502
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,653
<i>Others panicky.</i>

503
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,656
<i>Me ?</i>

504
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,826
<i>I feel... calm.</i>

505
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,339
- What are you doing here on a Saturday ?
- Oh, hey.

506
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:14,719
I'm just, uh, reanalyzing some
of the evidence from King's stolen car.

507
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,353
Frances, you came through.

508
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,107
Morgan.

509
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,735
Glad you're here.
I wanna talk to you.

510
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,821
Oh, shit. I didn't know she was here.

511
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,407
Did I say anything bad about her ?

512
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,910
You're not the one
she's gonna ream.

513
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,259
- Sit.
- Um...

514
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,680
that's OK.

515
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,309
It seems the ADA has noticed

516
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:06,228
that your personal
and professional lives are colliding.

517
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:08,689
All right.

518
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,860
Listen, Anton wasn't officially a CI
when that happened.

519
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,198
So it was a one-time thing ?

520
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,118
- No.
- Still going on ?

521
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,080
I'm not sure.

522
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,166
Do you want it to ?

523
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:34,340
I don't know. He could be
a key witness in my case.

524
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,385
Doesn't have to be your case.

525
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,599
You know what ?

526
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,601
You go ahead.

527
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,022
You take away my case. You take away
my shield. I don't care any more.

528
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,652
Because it wasn't the wrong decision.

529
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,321
I wanted to be with Anton.

530
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,449
I still want to be with Anton.

531
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,495
And there is no possible way
that us being together is a mistake.

532
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,083
Which means you're not sacrificing
your personal life to work.

533
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,380
Good for you.

534
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,515
Congratulations, Detective Morgan.

535
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,310
What ?

536
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,313
You're one of the smartest,
hardest-working,

537
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:35,568
most annoying pain-in-the-ass cops
in my department,

538
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,196
and you've earned this.

539
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,207
What about the ADA's ethics probe ?

540
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,299
The ADA is dead.

541
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:07,141
- Try one of these.
- Oh !

542
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,435
Ganache frosting.

543
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,023
You hold on to that personal life.

544
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,232
Yeah.

545
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,235
Reminds us what's important.

546
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,779
Cupcakes.

547
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,741
Abso-fucking-lutely.

548
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,840
<i>Such a familiar situation.</i>

549
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,429
<i>Such an unfamiliar perspective.</i>

550
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,271
<i>George King.</i>

551
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,440
<i>So Ramon wasn't
the only one following me.</i>

552
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,360
<i>I underestimated Miguel after all.</i>

553
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,989
<i>This is the part where my fear
is supposed to build.</i>

554
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,158
<i>I know his MO by heart.</i>

555
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,913
But you're not afraid.

556
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,668
No. I'm not.

557
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,379
I am.

558
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:23,092
I've been scared of it coming to this
your whole life,

559
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,718
a violent end.

560
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,683
- I tried to protect you.
- And you did.

561
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,102
This is my fault for not trusting you.

562
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,355
Instead I trusted
Miguel fucking Prado.

563
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,066
You did the best you could.

564
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:44,238
I need you to understand
something, Dexter.

565
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,783
So did I.

566
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,411
The very best I could.

567
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,832
I hope to be half as good a father
to my son.

568
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,959
Your son.

569
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,462
Dad.

570
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,258
I forgive you.

571
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,806
I've never seen you cry before.

572
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:15,144
They're not my tears, Dex.
They're yours.

573
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,396
I know, but I've never...

574
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,775
I've never felt this.

575
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,153
You've never had a son before.

576
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,322
You want to see him
come into the world ?

577
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,949
Yes.

578
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,995
To raise him with Rita.

579
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,164
To watch him grow up.

580
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,460
- To protect him.
- I know.

581
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,961
I didn't,

582
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:45,007
until now, when it's all
gonna be taken away.

583
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,176
I wanna be there for him.

584
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,973
I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

585
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,656
- Hey.
- Hi.

586
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,200
Come in.

587
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,874
You're completely
different from me.

588
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,003
You're laid-back and... musiciany and...

589
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,421
unambitious.

590
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,550
You're like Valium.

591
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:31,678
And you're like Red Bull.

592
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,516
You are the best thing
that has happened to me.

593
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,559
I'm still a witness in your case.

594
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,021
It's not my case. I recused myself.

595
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,107
You gave up a case ? This case ?

596
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,192
I had a choice.

597
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,777
I chose you.

598
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,490
Your turn.

599
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,745
I've already chosen.

600
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,290
OK.

601
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,545
Hold on. Hold on, I'll turn it off.

602
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,256
Wait, just, uh...

603
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,340
What ?

604
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,843
George King wasn't
at that cigar factory.

605
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,513
Fucking duh, but that's
not my case anymore.

606
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,639
Why ?

607
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:18,684
Well, I re-ran the tobacco
that we got from George King's stolen car.

608
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,353
It turns out it's at least
a dozen years old.

609
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,690
I called the cigar factory.
They only moved in there three years ago.

610
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,484
Where'd they move it ?

611
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,698
<i>I know that look.</i>

612
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,741
<i>I've had that look.</i>

613
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:36,994
<i>He likes control.</i>

614
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,704
<i>Needs it.</i>

615
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,833
<i>So I'll take it away from him.</i>

616
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,795
I killed Freebo.

617
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,299
Sorry about that.

618
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:55,637
I tied him up. Not unlike this.

619
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,640
Stabbed him
in the left carotid artery.

620
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:04,438
Used a 16-inch, carbon steel bone saw
to separate his limbs.

621
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,398
I don't believe you.

622
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:11,486
Divided them equally
amongst six biodegradable trash bags.

623
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,990
Which are long gone now,
carried north on the Gulf Stream.

624
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,415
You're lying.

625
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,167
Usually.

626
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,127
Not now.

627
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,378
No point.

628
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,673
Why would you have done
such a thing ?

629
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,885
Oh, I have my excuses
and justifications,

630
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,930
but, really, I just...

631
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,348
need to.

632
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,058
Like you.

633
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,935
You have your flimsy excuses -

634
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,312
finding Freebo,
getting your money.

635
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:48,232
But you know he's dead.

636
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,109
You know there's no money.

637
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,237
So really, you're just...

638
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:55,280
a killer,

639
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,740
a monster.

640
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,368
The stuff of nightmares.

641
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,372
I could kill you now.

642
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,499
If you can convince
yourself I'm lying,

643
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:09,336
that you need to skin me
to get information out of me.

644
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,007
You are lying.

645
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,468
You do know where he is.

646
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,054
Miguel Prado tell you that ?

647
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,724
He wanted me dead,
so he used you.

648
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,769
He played on your obsession.

649
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:29,606
It probably wasn't too hard.
I mean, you're a little single-minded.

650
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:35,028
Let's hope you're this talkative
once I get my tools.

651
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,709
<i>A wolf would chew off its own paw,
its survival instinct is that fierce.</i>

652
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,128
<i>So is mine.</i>

653
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,380
Aah !

654
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,718
Ahh.

655
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,122
Fuck !

656
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,504
King's truck, 11 o'clock.

657
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,970
Shit !

658
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:56,318
No way I could stop in time, ma'am.
He fucking came out of nowhere.

659
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,332
Jesus, Officer.
Scraped his fucking skin off.

660
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:14,503
Yeah, well, what goes around
comes around.

661
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:17,047
And it's "Detective".

662
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,138
Dexter's here.

663
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,474
- Just pulled up.
- Oh, finally.

664
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,436
Nothing to be concerned about,
but he kind of had a little accident.

665
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,065
- What happened ?
- He took a tumble down some stairs.

666
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,650
- Broke his hand.
- Oh, my God.

667
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:40,362
Rita, he's fine.
He can't wait to get married.

668
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,490
- Hi.
- Dexter !

669
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,076
Dexter, your room is down the hall.
You cannot be in here.

670
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,994
Wow. You look...

671
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,204
Wow.

672
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:52,249
You can't see her till the wedding.
It's bad luck.

673
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,918
I think I got
that one covered, sweetie.

674
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:57,087
Oh, baby, are you OK ?

675
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,006
Just embarrassed,
more than anything.

676
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,676
Sweetheart, why don't we go
and do your make-up ?

677
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,267
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

678
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:13,145
- You're not angry ?
- Why would I be ?

679
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,231
It's not like you broke your hand
on purpose.

680
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,443
I'm just glad you're here. Safe.

681
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:21,319
Me too.

682
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,737
All right, now go, go.

683
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,532
OK. Be ready in a jiffy.

684
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,956
You really do look beautiful.

685
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:37,335
<i>She wants to hold on to her secret
and I'm going to respect that.</i>

686
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:41,923
<i>It seems only fair,
given the secrets I keep from her.</i>

687
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:46,344
<i>We all have secrets. In that way,
I'm just like everyone else.</i>

688
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:48,138
<i>Sorta.</i>

689
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,145
Heard about your little fall.
Are you OK ?

690
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,482
Yeah, I'm fine. I heard
you nabbed George King.

691
00:46:58,608 --> 00:46:59,524
Yeah.

692
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,485
Great, big, scary Contra boogeyman

693
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:03,987
gets surrounded and takes
the chickenshit way out.

694
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,989
Death by cop.

695
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:08,492
I'm glad he's the only one
who got hurt.

696
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:10,035
Yeah, me too.

697
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,663
Ugh. Me in a dress.
I feel like a transvestite.

698
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,336
Come here.

699
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,840
Rabbit goes under the log...

700
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,092
hops over the log...

701
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,470
again...

702
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,640
then... through his hole.

703
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,648
Safe and sound.

704
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:44,986
- Thanks.
- Just remember, Cody has your rings.

705
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,197
And don't lock your knees
when you're standing up up there.

706
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,991
You'll drop like a goddamn stone.

707
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,201
Where are your vows ?

708
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,119
Right here.

709
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,871
I'm so happy for you.

710
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,167
Just wish Dad could be here.

711
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,004
I have a feeling he is.

712
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:11,346
Enough of this sappy shit.
Let's get you fucking hitched.

713
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,141
I honor you.

714
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,102
I love you.

715
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,020
I marry you.

716
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,873
I promise...

717
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,962
to be the very best husband

718
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,381
and father

719
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,718
that I can be.

720
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:56,850
<i>A completely, utterly honest vow.</i>

721
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,497
<i>Dexter Morgan, family man.</i>

722
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,293
<i>All my previous attempts
at human connection</i>

723
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,962
<i>have ended in... well, death.</i>

724
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:29,007
<i>And now I have a partner for life.</i>

725
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,259
<i>How did that happen ?</i>

726
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,012
<i>Am I drawn to the safety
of belonging</i>

727
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,265
<i>or being part of something
bigger than me ?</i>

728
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,269
<i>Either way, I'm a married man.</i>

729
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,438
<i>Soon to be a father.</i>

730
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,067
<i>But what do I have to offer a child ?</i>

731
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,196
<i>Just... me.</i>

732
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,491
<i>Demented daddy Dexter.</i>

733
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,328
<i>Maybe I'm making
the biggest mistake of my life.</i>

734
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:01,373
<i>But who's perfect ? Certainly not me.</i>

735
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,918
<i>Certainly not Harry.</i>

736
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:09,005
<i>Sure, I'm still who I was, who I am.</i>

737
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,758
<i>Question is, what do I become ?</i>

738
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:14,719
<i>There are so many blanks
left to fill in.</i>

739
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,515
<i>But right now, at this moment,
I'm content.</i>

740
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:20,934
<i>Maybe even...</i>

741
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,769
<i>happy.</i>

742
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:26,022
<i>And I have to admit,
when all is said and done...</i>

743
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,943
<i>life is good.</i>
