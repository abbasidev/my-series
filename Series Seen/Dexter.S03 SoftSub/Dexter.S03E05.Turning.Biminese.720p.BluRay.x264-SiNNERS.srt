1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,419
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,504
I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,714
I just think I'm gonna be a lousy
father. I don't wanna screw the kid up.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,676
Who are we kidding ?
You're gonna be a great father.

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,511
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria ?
- Ramon.

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:15,056
- We're working on some new angles.
- Which means you've got shit.

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,850
He's obsessed.
He's drinking more than usual.

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:22,021
He's not going to stop looking for Oscar's
killer until it takes him all the way down.

9
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,190
I only have one person
I can trust any more.

10
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,400
Yourself.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,609
I was thinking of you.

12
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,612
- What you need ?
- I need Freebo.

13
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,781
Come on man, what,
you Google him or something ?

14
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,368
Why wouldn't they want to support
a colleague during his shining moment ?

15
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,954
You're like the foulest person I've ever met.

16
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,499
I'm gonna do you a favor.
Call this guy.

17
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,418
Tell him you wanna cash in
one of my coupons.

18
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,920
He's an informant
from my days in Narcotics.

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,298
You, uh, you looking for
anything special tonight ?

20
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,426
Might be more than an hour.

21
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,598
Take a pass, Sergeant.

22
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,684
I hate anyone
who disgraces the badge.

23
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,602
Are we good ?

24
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,522
You keep your dick in your pants
and then we're good.

25
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,400
Rita, we're connected. I feel you.

26
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:08,985
You're what makes me real.

27
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,654
And that's how I know I wanna marry you.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,032
Yes ! Yes, we will marry you.

29
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,903
<i>There are many ways
to stop the heart.</i>

30
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,613
<i>Electric shock.</i>

31
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,948
<i>Bad diet.</i>

32
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,491
<i>Sever the aorta -</i>

33
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,326
<i>my personal favorite.</i>

34
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:26,539
<i>But to start one beating, this is a first.</i>

35
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,208
There. That's the heart.

36
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,211
Oh, Dex, that's our baby.

37
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,298
Our baby. It's incredible.

38
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,801
<i>Rita, gushing with the runaway emotion</i>

39
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,013
<i>any parent would feel
seeing their unborn child for the first time.</i>

40
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,141
<i>Any parent except me.</i>

41
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,019
I'd say you're at nine to ten weeks.

42
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,688
<i>All I feel is her hand clenching mine.</i>

43
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,026
<i>She's stronger than she looks.</i>

44
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,571
Can we get a picture to show the kids ?

45
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,742
<i>I can no longer deny
that I'm going to be a father.</i>

46
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,286
<i>Up until now,
I've been avoiding its inevitability.</i>

47
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,915
<i>It's like a lamp in a room
that's always been there.</i>

48
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,918
<i>And now it's suddenly turned on.</i>

49
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,421
Don't worry.
Everything looks perfectly normal.

50
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,178
Yes.

51
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,890
Front or back pocket ?

52
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,727
- You lost me.
- The picture of the baby.

53
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,228
Front or back pocket ?

54
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:35,149
- How'd you know I'd have it with me ?
- You're a first-time dad, aren't you ?

55
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,526
Ah !

56
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,446
Oh, this is amazing !

57
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,033
This is a human life.

58
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,994
It is... overwhelming.

59
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,956
This picture right here makes it real.

60
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,167
Your life is gonna change forever, man.

61
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,673
Hey ! We're playing here !

62
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,716
You could kill somebody !

63
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,221
Sorry.

64
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,932
I got half my mind
still in the office, you know ?

65
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,560
Oh, there's your ball.

66
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,772
So I got this case, you know ?

67
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,567
South Beach guy
kills his wife on a cruise ship.

68
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:22,697
And I got no jurisdiction because
she goes missing in international waters.

69
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,532
My only hope right now is the Feds.

70
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,034
- How do you know he's guilty ?
- Oh, he's guilty.

71
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,040
Five years ago, he kills his first wife.
Drug overdose.

72
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,251
His pills. No alibi.

73
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:40,006
Then he uses her money to hire this legal
dream team to confuse the jury and...

74
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,674
They had to let him go.

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,010
Dexter, my hands are tied by the law,

76
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:46,387
and the defense attorneys
get to wipe their asses with it.

77
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,723
And everything that I believe in
is compromised.

78
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,143
That's you.

79
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,645
<i>It seems Miguel and I
understand each other</i>

80
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,897
<i>better than either one of us knows.</i>

81
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,234
<i>I could do us both a favor
and look into this wife killer.</i>

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,987
<i>When it comes to my brand of justice,</i>

83
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,573
<i>I don't have to compromise.</i>

84
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,200
Ooh.

85
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,911
Sliced it.

86
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,913
<i>Yeah.</i>

87
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,751
Thank you again for inviting us.

88
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,670
That massage was amazing.

89
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,839
We spend enough money
to be members here.

90
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,758
At least now I have somebody
to go to the spa with.

91
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,136
All of that stuff,
that's not for men, right, Dex ?

92
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:31,265
Lying naked on a table, helpless,
no thanks.

93
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,936
So, Rita, why don't you tell Dexter
my great idea ?

94
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,438
Great idea ?

95
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,901
Well, Syl has offered to list
my house with her agency

96
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,945
so we can buy something
bigger together.

97
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,741
You're just throwing money away
on that apartment.

98
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,535
And that way you can move in sooner.

99
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,497
I was actually thinking
I might keep my place.

100
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,458
You were ?

101
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,794
Well, I could always sublet it.

102
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,923
At some point we're gonna need
a bigger home.

103
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,384
You definitely need something
that you can grow into.

104
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:12,723
<i>This is how Custer must have felt,
surrounded on all sides, doomed.</i>

105
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,644
So why don't we talk about all this
after we eat ?

106
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,108
Oh, the line's thinning.

107
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:26,195
Come on, Rita.
You have got to try these crêpes.

108
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,243
It's going to be OK. Trust me.

109
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,122
I'm so sorry, man.

110
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,542
Syl, she gets these ideas in her head,
and it's like you can't stop her.

111
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,545
I guess I always knew at some point
I'd have to give up my place.

112
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,673
I just didn't think it'd be so soon.

113
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,511
Every man needs his privacy.
Some more than others.

114
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,472
But that's why God created golf.

115
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,064
<i>How many times have I walked
down this sidewalk ?</i>

116
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,233
<i>Sun in my face.</i>

117
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,819
<i>Cool ocean breeze on my skin.</i>

118
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,363
<i>Taken a dip in the pool to relax,</i>

119
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,908
<i>appreciating the wisdom
of those three little words -</i>

120
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,869
<i>no children allowed.</i>

121
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,998
<i>Are those times gone forever ?</i>

122
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,046
<i>Before I even think about
following up on Miguel's lead,</i>

123
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,592
<i>I need to make sure
Ethan Turner meets my code.</i>

124
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,604
<i>How can Rita expect me
to just pick up and move ?</i>

125
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,856
<i>This is my home.</i>

126
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,651
<i>My sanctuary.</i>

127
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,872
Careful.

128
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,290
Leave it.

129
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,921
Not really Rita's style.

130
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,797
But it's mine.

131
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:13,093
Not any more, son.
In marriage, everything's 50-50.

132
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,389
What's yours... is Rita's.

133
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,861
Better hope she doesn't insist
on a place with central air.

134
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:52,174
<i>Rita and Syl may be busy planning my life
and where I'll live.</i>

135
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,928
<i>But there are some things
I still control.</i>

136
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:03,018
Right on time. You're getting pretty good
at this secret meeting stuff.

137
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,981
Yeah, well, we've done it enough.
With bumpkus to show for it.

138
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,068
It's "bupkus".
Not "bumpkus". It's Yiddish.

139
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,611
No, it's not.

140
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,489
- You wanna bet ?
- How much ?

141
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,324
Make it a million.

142
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,493
I'll take a check.

143
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,414
Where's your guy ?

144
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,749
In the alley behind you.

145
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,421
Wonderful.

146
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,339
I love the smell of ass in the morning.

147
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,009
Hey, you're the one that's been
all over mine for leads.

148
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,969
Don't be hating where I find them.

149
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,595
I know, I know.

150
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,643
Well, you better split before we get made.

151
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,563
Well, that's cute.

152
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,357
- What ?
- You. Trying to protect me like that.

153
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,900
It's cute.

154
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,737
I'm trying to protect my investigation.

155
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,405
Uh-huh.

156
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,158
And fuck you.

157
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,835
- What the hell ?
- He wasn't like this earlier.

158
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,672
I'm trying to find whoever's skinning people,
not to stage an intervention.

159
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,008
You think your murders
are somehow connected to Freebo ?

160
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,470
He used to score from Freebo.
It's worth a shot, right ?

161
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,852
Excuse me.

162
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,106
Anyone in there ?

163
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,108
Anyone fucking in there at all ?

164
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,445
I'll bet you're real good with kids too.

165
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,659
Hey, Tilly.

166
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,871
Hey, I got that H for you, man.

167
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,249
- Where ?
- It's right here.

168
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:53,128
But listen, I need you to think
real hard for me first, Tilly.

169
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,464
Now, when was the last time
you saw Freebo ?

170
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,927
Fucker's gone, man.

171
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,680
Wendell said he's not coming back.

172
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,601
Who the fuck is Wendell ?

173
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,814
You wanna see Freebo,
you gotta go through Wendell.

174
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:20,656
Sheriff 2-1,
this is dispatch. Wagon is on its way.

175
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,409
Metro Homicide.

176
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,287
What are we doing at a sheriff's
crime scene anyway ?

177
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,790
- Sheriff, you're blocking my light.
- Whoa, Jesus.

178
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,458
- Excuse me.
- Sheriffs are responding

179
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,045
to a bulletin I issued regarding
any victims with missing skin.

180
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,255
Excuse me.

181
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,342
Same MO as our torture murder ?

182
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,929
Remember, you two are just here
to observe. This is the sheriff's turf.

183
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,850
They're gonna investigate the scene,
see what they can come up with.

184
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,810
What's up with him ?

185
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,605
He doesn't joke around anymore.
He dresses better. He's polite.

186
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,275
Maybe someone pointed out
the error in his ways.

187
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,318
- Who called this in ?
- Neighbors.

188
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,785
I just got off the phone
with the sheriff's department.

189
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,663
They've confirmed their skinning victim
is related to ours.

190
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,459
That gives us three victims. They're sending
someone over to look at our case files,

191
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,128
and we'll be establishing
a joint investigation.

192
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:20,340
- This is our investigation, Lieutenant.
- You can't expect us to give over our files.

193
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,927
No one is giving over anything.
It's a matter of professional courtesy.

194
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,679
We're still in charge.

195
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,892
Now, I've had the sheriff's lab send over
all forensics. I want both your input.

196
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,228
- My slate's clear.
- I'll talk with the medical examiner.

197
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,689
Another four-hour erection ?

198
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,902
Anything else ?

199
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,864
I've got Unis bringing in a 15-year-old kid
named Wendell Owens.

200
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,742
He was Freebo's doorman, which means
he might be able to connect the dots

201
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,536
between his boss and why people
who knew him keep winding up dead.

202
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,788
I may be one of those dots.

203
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,000
He's a minor.
Get consent from a parent to question him.

204
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,211
I'll make sure everything's
done by the book.

205
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,755
All right, I want updates on the hour.

206
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,926
- Good work, partner.
- Yeah, right.

207
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,646
<i>Wendell.</i>

208
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,567
<i>I doubt this boy would recognize me
from the day I met his dead boss.</i>

209
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,529
<i>But why take the chance ?</i>

210
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,738
Dexter Morgan.

211
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,114
Hey, Dex.

212
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,451
Listen, I'm gonna have to cancel our lunch.

213
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,579
- Everything all right ?
- Rough morning, man.

214
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:37,125
Feds informed me that they're not gonna
move forward on this cruise ship case.

215
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,669
Lack of evidence.

216
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,256
Got a witness puts this son of a bitch
on the deck with his wife

217
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:47,219
just before she went missing,
and he's still gonna walk. Again !

218
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,514
Did I mention he left his first wife's
teenage daughters penniless ?

219
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,015
<i>No need.</i>

220
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,268
A whole family destroyed.

221
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,270
We could meet later if you want.

222
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,022
No, no, I'm gonna be in court, man.
How 'bout tomorrow ?

223
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,816
I may have plans. I'll let you know.

224
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,402
<i>There's due diligence to be done.</i>

225
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,703
How long is this gonna take ?

226
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:16,373
The sooner you tell me where we can find
your mom, the sooner you're outta here.

227
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,421
She wasn't at your house.
We can't reach her by phone.

228
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,339
Does she have a job ?

229
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,593
She does what she has to do.
Same as me.

230
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,938
You know, I was about your age
when my mom died.

231
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,442
Suddenly, my father's
raising two teenagers by himself,

232
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:47,070
so I get how hard it is
for a single parent to always be there.

233
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,698
Yeah, I bet you had it real bad.

234
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,202
No, I didn't.

235
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:58,165
My dad worked really hard to get me
and my brother the things he didn't have.

236
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,792
So I got why he wasn't always home.

237
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,963
But after a while, I even stopped
looking for him at my softball games.

238
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,592
Didn't mean he didn't love me,

239
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,803
didn't mean it didn't hurt.

240
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,014
You played softball for real ?

241
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,391
First base.

242
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,144
But you don't look gay.

243
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,903
You hungry ?

244
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,280
Yeah, but not for any
of that vending machine shit.

245
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:35,786
Well, I'll tell you what, if you're brave
enough, there's a roach coach outside.

246
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:36,995
I'm buying.

247
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:45,337
OK, I'll take some burgers, fries
and onion rings.

248
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,090
Deal.

249
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,010
Partner, would you keep an eye
on our guest ?

250
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,446
- Getting anywhere with the kid ?
- Sort of.

251
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,949
- You and Rita set a date yet ?
- Not yet.

252
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,411
- Well, are you gonna move in with her first ?
- Where's this going ?

253
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,455
I need to know, so I can break the lease
on my place and move into yours.

254
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,750
What makes everybody think
I'm just gonna give up my apartment ?

255
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,919
Maybe cause you're getting married.

256
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,588
Like there's room for Rita
and the kids at your place.

257
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,092
No offense, but you're the last person
who needs a fuck pad.

258
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,764
Dexter. Officer Morgan.

259
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,517
Can you tell me
where I might find Lieutenant LaGuerta ?

260
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,062
Thank you so much.

261
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,357
Guess we know who the sheriff's
department sent to look into our files.

262
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,818
Big fucking mistake.
That guy's wound way too tight.

263
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,154
And coming from me,
that's saying something.

264
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,364
You gonna take the fridge ?

265
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,120
- Thank you.
- They keep getting younger, huh ?

266
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,205
- Who'd this one kill ?
- The boy's not a suspect.

267
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,250
We think he was working for Freebo.

268
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:09,838
I have to say, I'm surprised the sheriff's
department chose you as their liaison.

269
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,466
I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to do my job.

270
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,973
I've known you your entire adult life, Ramon,
so let's cut the bullshit.

271
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,641
You're using this case

272
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,103
to insert yourself into Miami Metro's
investigation of your brother's death.

273
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:29,441
If our victim can help track down
my brother's killer in the process,

274
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,234
so be it.

275
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,571
As one lieutenant to another,
you know I could go over your head

276
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,782
and get you pulled off this assignment.

277
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,701
But I'm not gonna do that.

278
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,580
I know you and Oscar were close
and he meant a great deal to me as well.

279
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,627
So you will have
this department's full cooperation

280
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,378
to a point.

281
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:54,466
If it turns out that these cases
are not connected, the cooperation ends.

282
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:55,634
¿ Entiendes ?

283
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:58,678
Claro.

284
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:09,981
<i>I need to thank Miguel for introducing me
to a new hobby.</i>

285
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,775
<i>And for supporting an old one.</i>

286
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,450
<i>After the first wife's money ran out,</i>

287
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:24,704
<i>Ethan didn't take long to find the next
wealthy woman to woo, marry,</i>

288
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,374
<i>and throw overboard.</i>

289
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,877
<i>Maybe I can return the favor
on that last part.</i>

290
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,173
Have both tanks delivered to the ship.

291
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,678
- I'll need a dive skin too.
- You got it.

292
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,722
Heading out to sea ?

293
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,392
Caribbean cruise.
Leaving tomorrow.

294
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,769
Do you know any good
dive schools around here ?

295
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,232
Yeah. But they all require hours
for certification.

296
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,277
If I were you, I'd cut a few corners,
head over to Bimini.

297
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,696
They'll have you under the water
in less than a day.

298
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,324
Bimini. That's close.
I could be there and back in my boat.

299
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,870
The water's beautiful there.
It's my first port of call.

300
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:10,333
Maybe I could take the wife, get her off
my back for never doing anything with her.

301
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,004
You'll have more fun if you don't.

302
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,679
I'm sure I will.

303
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,639
There you are.

304
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,976
Good news. Wendell's mother
finally answered her phone.

305
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:32,188
- Patrol's bringing her upstairs now.
- Yes. Thank the baby fucking Jesus.

306
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,649
You do know I'm Catholic, right ?

307
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,277
I'm sorry, but I've had that kid
at my desk all afternoon.

308
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,446
Hey, you ever hear the word
"bumpkus" ?

309
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,947
I think it's "bupkus".

310
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,991
- Shit.
- Yeah, hold on now.

311
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:47,370
There's this cold case
I'm looking at, a dead john.

312
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:53,001
Now, when you were working vice, did you
bust the same places over and over again ?

313
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,128
Um, not really.

314
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,590
Most guys are regulars,
so word gets out quick if a place is hot.

315
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,342
So we'd move the decoys around.

316
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:05,221
But if you really want to know about
paying for sex, you should talk to Masuka.

317
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,140
Hey, Vince, hold up.

318
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:12,228
Did you get a chance to look at the sheriff's
department forensics regarding their vic ?

319
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,774
I fucking would, if they'd fucking send them.
I've called four fucking times.

320
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,485
Man ! Somebody needs a hug.

321
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,779
I'd offer, but I don't know what I'd catch.

322
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,823
Can I go now ?

323
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,451
You know, I can take inappropriate Masuka.

324
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,829
I can take porn-loving Masuka.
I can even take flatulent Masuka.

325
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,083
But this dress-shoe-wearing,
"please and thank you" zombie Masuka

326
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,542
is fucking creeping me out.

327
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,503
What's going on ?

328
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,673
Maybe I'm realizing no one
around here is my friend.

329
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,218
The only time you people even acknowledge
me is when you want something.

330
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,721
That's not so.
We put you on our bowling team.

331
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,308
Only to keep everyone's handicap higher
to sandbag the other teams.

332
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:54,980
- OK, that's true, but...
- Not one person read my paper.

333
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,733
Not one fucking person showed up
at the conference I spoke at.

334
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,277
This is about your stupid paper ?

335
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,656
You guys just don't get it.

336
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,412
You hurt my feelings.

337
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:27,429
What the fuck ?

338
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,557
Where's the kid ?

339
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:35,020
The mother wouldn't give consent.
I had to cut him loose.

340
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:37,564
Did you explain to her
how important it was that we talk to him ?

341
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,858
The moment I brought up Freebo's name,
she clammed up.

342
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:43,778
Word is the last person who talked to
the cops about Freebo wound up dead.

343
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,448
I spent all day getting through to that kid.

344
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,784
He would have talked, or he would have
convinced his mother to let him talk.

345
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,164
- She was never gonna cooperate.
- You coulda waited until I got back.

346
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,916
Look, this is no reflection
on the work you did here.

347
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,712
No, it's a reflection on how little
you think of me and my work.

348
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,506
You think I cut this kid loose
to make you look bad ?

349
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,761
I'm not sure any more.

350
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,554
Partner.

351
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,399
Hey, baby. You want a date ?

352
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,320
Hey, sugar. What you look...

353
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,705
You have got to be kidding me.

354
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,333
I'm not here for that, honest.

355
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,586
Your... You know, your...

356
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,591
- You're blushing.
- I'm not.

357
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,427
So what, uh, what are you doing
down here, Sergeant ?

358
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,930
Cause I gotta get back to work.

359
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,474
I came here because I...

360
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,976
I wanted to know if...

361
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,772
if you'd like to grab
something to eat sometime.

362
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,650
You know, to talk.

363
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,610
And to eat.

364
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,074
I'm not interested.

365
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,660
I rarely date cops.

366
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,037
"Rarely," does that mean "never" ?

367
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,917
If I meant "never",
I would have said "never".

368
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,926
Dex, is that you ?
I'm in the kitchen.

369
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:34,639
- What smells so good ?
- It's a surprise.

370
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,729
Look. Brochures of houses.

371
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,527
I know it's fast. But Syl and I spent
the whole day doing drive-bys,

372
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,029
and these are the ones
I fell in love with.

373
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,614
All of them ?

374
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,451
Well, they're in great school districts,
big yards, plenty of bedrooms,

375
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,953
central air.

376
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,248
I thought we could go through these
after dinner and have Syl

377
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,292
schedule some showings for tomorrow.

378
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,044
<i>I understand that, as man and wife,</i>

379
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,047
<i>Rita and I will have to live
under the same roof.</i>

380
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:11,050
<i>So why is it the only word
echoing in my head is...</i>

381
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,011
No.

382
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,682
No ?

383
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,393
Um...

384
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,897
OK, I guess we don't
have to look at all of them.

385
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,231
No.

386
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:31,029
"No" doesn't really work
in a relationship, Dexter.

387
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,073
"Can we talk about it ?"
is a little more productive.

388
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,911
I'm sorry,
but I don't want to look at houses.

389
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,038
Not now anyway.

390
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,753
Fine, that's all you had to say.

391
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:53,134
If Syl and I go out to look tomorrow in the
morning, can you watch Astor and Cody ?

392
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,970
No, I'm going fishing tomorrow.

393
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,724
I'm gonna be gone all day.

394
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,101
And you were gonna tell me this when ?

395
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,771
Rita, this is the first
I'm hearing about house hunting.

396
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:08,399
I can't just drop everything at the last minute
because you want me to.

397
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,278
Dinner will be ready in five minutes.

398
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,988
It's a roast.

399
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,740
Your favorite.

400
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,165
<i>I double-checked
Ethan's ship itinerary.</i>

401
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,251
<i>He's in Bimini today only.</i>

402
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,462
<i>Gives me one shot
to head him off at the pass.</i>

403
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,424
<i>Sorry, Rita, but right now I need this
more than a big yard and a two-car garage.</i>

404
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,468
Hey !

405
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,763
Ahoy.

406
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,432
Let me guess - Syl ?

407
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,811
She might have mentioned
that Rita and she were going house hunting

408
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:49,440
because a certain gilipollas
decided that he'd rather go fishing.

409
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,860
- Gilipollas ?
- You don't wanna know.

410
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:56,281
So this is the boat you keep talking about,
huh ? Wow, she's a beauty.

411
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,701
- You gonna take me out on her sometime ?
- Sure thing.

412
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,496
So what brings you out here ?

413
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,040
Thought maybe we could grab some food
before you go out.

414
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,418
Kind of like a rain check for yesterday.

415
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,462
Ah, can't leave the boat.
Everything's onboard.

416
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,131
Olvidate. OK.

417
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,510
Don't worry about it.
So where are they biting ?

418
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,264
Um, heading up north, Mercy Reef.
Always had good luck there.

419
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:27,353
I got half a mind to postpone the
arraignment that I have and just go with you.

420
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,980
<i>Please don't.</i>

421
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,610
Nah. I gotta be in court.

422
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:36,654
Ah !

423
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,868
I'm gonna try to put out some fire
that your lieutenant started.

424
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,583
But I'm glad I caught you, you know ?

425
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:52,587
Hey, how 'bout whatever you catch,
we put on the grill tonight ?

426
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,380
Wish me luck.

427
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,105
Thanks for coming in early.

428
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,401
Lieutenant Prado wanted to get us
all up to speed on the Skinner case.

429
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,405
Thank you.
This is our vic's boyfriend.

430
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,949
Now, no one's seen him
since the night in question.

431
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,494
We could use your help
tracking him down.

432
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,579
Soderquist, Ramos, you're on it.

433
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,041
I was also hoping I could speak with
a couple of your previous witnesses.

434
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,211
"Speak with" as in
we didn't do it right the first time ?

435
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,422
Cases evolve.
Witnesses change their story.

436
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,884
Junior personnel, they make mistakes.
No disrespect.

437
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,344
Actually, it's a lot of disrespect.

438
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,970
You've come into our house twice.

439
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:44,764
You not only insult our police work,

440
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,810
now you're insulting one of the most
dedicated officers I've ever partnered with.

441
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,103
Yes, you.

442
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,479
It's bullshit, my man.

443
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,985
Let's not lose sight of the fact
that we want the same thing here -

444
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:01,406
to find whoever is responsible
for these murders.

445
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,616
Uh, there is one slight problem.

446
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,285
Your case has nothing to do with our case.

447
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,581
- The vic wasn't skinned ?
- Not like our previous victims.

448
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:14,210
There were minute traces of ink
in the papillary and reticular...

449
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,629
English.

450
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,090
Someone dug out a tattoo
from the back of her neck.

451
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,466
Postmortem.

452
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,804
Which is another reason why
I don't think we're looking at the same killer.

453
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,640
It's all right here
in the county medical examiner's report.

454
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,892
That's your opinion.
My lab thinks differently.

455
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,436
Let me see that.

456
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,105
- You're not taking this seriously, are you ?
- In a fucking heartbeat.

457
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,315
Do you know how many times
Vince Masuka's been published ?

458
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,776
He's our lead forensic investigator.

459
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,070
And there's no one better.

460
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,990
Our victim was strangled,
the same as yours.

461
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:50,079
Hemorrhaging in the eyes and bruising
would lead one to conclude strangulation.

462
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,165
Unless you're me.

463
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,877
You were so busy playing hide the sausage
with the ME's report,

464
00:29:56,003 --> 00:30:00,089
you were hoping I'd miss the cotton fibers
in the nose and airways.

465
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:04,927
Your victim was smothered.
That's not opinion. That's science.

466
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:09,682
And science is one cold-hearted bitch
with a 14-inch strap-on.

467
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:14,645
- And he's back.
- Well, I think we're through here.

468
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,817
I'm not so sure your lieutenant
would agree, Sergeant.

469
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,279
Then you don't know her
as well as you thought, Lieutenant.

470
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,682
Ethan.

471
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,853
<i>Apparently Ethan is looking for more
than adventure on the high seas.</i>

472
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,231
<i>Both of his deceased wives had prenups.</i>

473
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,567
<i>In a divorce, he would have
been lucky to keep the Rolex.</i>

474
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,653
<i>But he wanted it all.</i>

475
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,405
Ethan made a choice.

476
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,868
And pretty soon, you're gonna
have to make one too, Dex.

477
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,788
Ethan chose to be rich
rather than married.

478
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,626
I, on the other hand,
chose to stay with Doris, even after...

479
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:19,961
You cheated on her ?

480
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,590
You think you and I
are so different, don't you ?

481
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,218
I'm nothing like you.

482
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,053
Really ?

483
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,723
You're here and Rita's back home.

484
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:36,269
You're cheating on her
and you don't even realize it.

485
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:40,815
I'll make time for my dark passenger
and for Rita.

486
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,901
It's about priorities, Dexter.

487
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,238
You're gonna have to choose
which one is your mistress

488
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,740
and which one is your wife.

489
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,411
And more importantly,
which one comes first.

490
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,084
Harry, you missed a spot.

491
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,299
Oh, hi, baby.

492
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,303
Hi, Mom.

493
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,435
Attention,
all Atlantic Sun Cruise passengers,

494
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,562
this is Bebay, your cruise director.

495
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:23,899
The next sea taxi is leaving Bimini
for our ship in 20 minutes.

496
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,781
It looked much bigger from out here.

497
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,160
You could always knock out a wall or two.
It's easier than you think.

498
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,662
How about the kitchen ?

499
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,207
Well, the bay window was nice.
But those cabinets...

500
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,044
Don't get bogged down in the cosmetic stuff.

501
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,921
How did it feel when you were inside ?

502
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,049
Like a home.

503
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,053
God, you're good.

504
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,348
You're my friend, Rita. I wouldn't
put you in something I didn't believe in.

505
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,683
And I believe that this home
can work for you.

506
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,852
For your family.

507
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,854
Oh...

508
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,815
What are the rules about using the
bathroom in a house you're showing ?

509
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,485
- No rules. You gotta go, you gotta go.
- All right.

510
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,742
Can I see your venture
passport, sir ? Thank you.

511
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,577
Keep coming.

512
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,664
Excuse me, sir. Can I take a look
at your venture passport ? Thank you.

513
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:24,085
Ma'am, could I see your pass ?
Thank you.

514
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,546
Attention all
Atlantic Sun Cruise passengers,

515
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,757
this is Bebay, your cruise director.

516
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,719
The sea taxi is departing Bimini
for our ship in five minutes.

517
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:38,391
Please remember that the last sea taxi of
the evening leaves the ship at 10:45 tonight.

518
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,310
All visitors, guests,
anyone who doesn't belong on board

519
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,145
must disembark at that time.

520
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,563
<i>It'll be tight.</i>

521
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,692
<i>But I think both Ethan Turner and I
will be off the ship by that time.</i>

522
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:51,362
<i>Of course, only one of us
will be doing so because he wants to.</i>

523
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:56,742
Rita ?

524
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,662
I'm bleeding.

525
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,997
Oh, my God.

526
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:04,667
All right, there's a hospital five blocks away.

527
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,128
Waiting for an ambulance
is only gonna take time.

528
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:09,964
- What about Dexter ?
- We'll call from the car.

529
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,387
Those things will kill you, you know ?

530
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,265
I'll talk to you later.

531
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:23,269
I've been by here four times
looking for you.

532
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,313
What for ?
The other cop said you couldn't talk to me.

533
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,067
Well, he's right. I can't. Officially.

534
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,863
But unofficially,
there's no reason you can't call me

535
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,075
just in case there's something
you want to tell me about your ex-boss.

536
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,414
Burgers, fries and onion rings.

537
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,014
I know the situation with
your mom not being around really sucks.

538
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,517
But if things get really bad,
you use that card and call me, OK ?

539
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,855
I kept my nose outta Freebo's business.

540
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,065
It was safer that way.

541
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,694
Do you have any idea where he is ?

542
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,321
No.

543
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,823
I know he was into someone
for some major cash.

544
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,074
He was pretty scared.

545
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:21,911
That's probably why
he's hiding out somewhere.

546
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:26,832
That explains why someone's trying so hard
to find him. They want their money back.

547
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,335
- So are we done ?
- We're done.

548
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,505
- Oh, yeah, one other thing.
- Yeah ?

549
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:37,218
When you find that jerk-off, tell him
he still owes me three weeks' pay.

550
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,678
Thanks.

551
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,972
Watch yourself out here, OK ?

552
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,557
OK.

553
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:51,083
- Miguel, thank God you're here.
- How is she ?

554
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,753
They rushed her to prenatal ICU
but they won't tell me a thing. I'm not family.

555
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,089
OK.

556
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,926
Miss. Hi, my name is Miguel Prado.
I'm the Assistant District Attorney.

557
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,013
I need you to find your chief of staff,
Dr. Reynolds, and have him call...

558
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:08,100
- I'm just an admit nurse. You're...
- Hey, call him.

559
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,561
Right now.

560
00:37:12,606 --> 00:37:14,523
I feel so bad for Rita. She's all alone.

561
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,776
Baby, baby, Reynolds is gonna make sure
she gets the best care in Miami.

562
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:21,280
Why isn't Dexter back ?
I've been calling all day.

563
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,533
Goddamn it,
the father should be here.

564
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,330
I enjoyed shuffling through your iPod
to make sure that no one hears us.

565
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:32,291
Of course, most of your shipmates
are up on the blue deck.

566
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,168
It's happy hour.
Just the two of us.

567
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,045
# Ch-ch-ch-changes

568
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:39,048
# Turn and face the strange

569
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,800
# Ch-ch-ch-changes... #

570
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:44,929
Oh, it's too bad
I have to make this quick.

571
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:49,183
I'm usually all for a stimulating conversation
at times like this.

572
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:51,101
But the last sea taxi leaves in an hour.

573
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,191
# Time may change me... #

574
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,735
I've been going through
some changes myself lately.

575
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,823
I'm getting married.
I've got a baby on the way. Me.

576
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,994
Even though my life
may never be the same,

577
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,457
I want to thank you for reminding me
how important it is to take time for oneself.

578
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,543
# Ch-ch-ch-changes... #

579
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,296
Savor these moments alone.

580
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,382
# Changes

581
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,634
# Oh, look out you rock and rollers

582
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,722
<i>And here I am. Paradox personified.</i>

583
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,266
<i>Taking life.</i>

584
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,645
<i>Creating life.</i>

585
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:52,788
<i>With the ship anchored away from shore,
the Gulf Stream will be Ethan's last cruise.</i>

586
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,832
<i>Bon voyage.</i>

587
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,803
This isn't like Dexter.
Something's wrong.

588
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:11,473
Sweetie, I know this is difficult,
but you need to stay calm.

589
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,102
I sent the coast guard to look for him.
He wasn't at his fishing spot.

590
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,146
Maybe he's back at the marina by now.

591
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,606
Then why hasn't he called ?

592
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,906
Anton, open up. It's me.

593
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,911
I tried calling. I got a lead.

594
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,414
I know why someone's looking
for you-know-who.

595
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:45,299
Hurry up if you want your money.

596
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:48,218
Yes, I was wrong about...

597
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,848
bupkus.

598
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,558
Hi.

599
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,895
Hi. Is Anton here ?

600
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,730
He's in the shower.

601
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:04,068
Oh, he'll be out soon, cause I think
we used up all the hot water.

602
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,279
I can get him.

603
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,364
Oh, no, that's all right.

604
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:13,327
Just, um, have him call Debra Morgan.

605
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,953
It's important.

606
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,623
- Are you sure you don't want me to...
- Thanks.

607
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,798
What ?

608
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,592
Hello, Debra.
This is Miguel Prado.

609
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,470
Have you heard from Dexter ?

610
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,680
Uh, no. Why ?

611
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,600
Well, we're at the hospital
with Rita right now.

612
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:42,606
- Hospital ? Everything all right ?
- Debra, we need to find your brother.

613
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,033
<i>Ethan Turner was incapable of compromise.</i>

614
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:58,539
<i>He loved his wives' money
more than he loved them.</i>

615
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,125
<i>And in the end, it cost him dearly.</i>

616
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,379
<i>I don't wanna be like Ethan.</i>

617
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,510
<i>Maybe my days of coming
and going as I please are over.</i>

618
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,680
<i>But that doesn't mean my life is over.</i>

619
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:25,858
<i>Not as long as I have my boat
and the open water.</i>

620
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,193
<i>There are some things
I can keep to myself.</i>

621
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,534
You have 12 unheard messages.

622
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,371
Dex, it's me.

623
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,123
I'm on my way to the hospital.

624
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,959
I think there's something
wrong with the baby.

625
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,013
The baby ?

626
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,392
The baby's fine.

627
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,732
They said if I stay on bed rest
the next few days that I can...

628
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,528
we can go home tomorrow.

629
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:21,371
I don't know what I would have done
if I'd lost the baby and you weren't here.

630
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,585
- Hey.
- And nobody could find you.

631
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,046
I'm here now.

632
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,509
And I'm not going anywhere.

633
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:46,355
I think maybe we should wait
to find a house until after we're married.

634
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,443
Just name the date.

635
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,820
I'm ready.

636
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:04,539
I'd like to walk down the aisle
before I start to show.

637
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,918
Whatever you want.

638
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:29,398
<i>I may never be able to feel
our baby's heartbeat emotionally.</i>

639
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,567
<i>But I know now I can't ignore it either.</i>

640
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:35,612
<i>And for some reason I can't explain,</i>

641
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,615
<i>I'm relieved to know it's still here.</i>

642
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,245
Fishing ?

643
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,750
That's where you were all night ?

644
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,003
Deb...

645
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:54,715
You can't make me feel any worse
than I already do.

646
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,845
Well, I hope this was
a big wake-up call for you.

647
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,181
Cause you're gonna be a father
before you know it.

648
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,893
Yeah, I see that now.

649
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,980
My life is changing.

650
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:13,442
And if it'll make you happy,
my place is yours.

651
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,531
What'll make me happy
is you being there for that kid.

652
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,993
For homework and plays.

653
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,788
And softball games.

654
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,584
Don't you dare be like Dad.

655
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,504
That's never gonna happen.

656
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,684
Quite a night, huh ?

657
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,482
I should have been here.

658
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,318
Well, Syl and I were.

659
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,528
That's what friends are for.

660
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,537
- I owe you one.
- I just may take you up on that someday.

661
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,002
You know, my office got the strangest fax
tonight from Atlantic Sun Cruises.

662
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:18,048
Remember that guy whose wife
disappeared on some cruise ?

663
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:22,511
Get this, he was reported missing
about an hour ago.

664
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:28,266
Where was it that you say you went fishing ?

665
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,604
Mercy Reef.

666
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,358
Yeah, Mercy Reef.
That's what I thought you said.

667
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:42,739
Cause when I sent the coast guard
over there, they couldn't find you.

668
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,284
The ocean's a big place.

669
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,414
Or maybe you weren't at Mercy Reef.

670
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,793
Where else would I have been ?

671
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:01,049
Bimini's... What, 40 miles away ?

672
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:05,554
- I went fishing. You watched me leave.
- You were on that cruise ship.

673
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,266
Do you know how crazy that sounds ?

674
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:12,978
You were on that cruise ship
finishing what I couldn't.

675
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,358
Wasn't me.

676
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:23,196
You were making sure that Ethan Turner
could never hurt another innocent soul.

677
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,990
It's getting late. You should go.

678
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:29,494
It's OK.
Dexter, you and I, we're the same.

679
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,788
No one is like me.

680
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,498
You're wrong.

681
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,836
Hey, you... You're wrong.

682
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:41,214
Don't you see what happened today ?

683
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,135
I gave you the chance to avenge two women
whom the system failed,

684
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:50,015
and just like I hoped,
you seized that opportunity.

685
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,851
It's not like that.

686
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,644
Dexter...

687
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:58,356
You don't have to lie to me.

688
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,026
Don't you understand ?

689
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,777
Hey, I see who you are.

690
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,072
No, you can't.

691
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,574
No one can.

692
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,409
You have nothing to explain to me.

693
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,245
Nothing to apologize for.

694
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,663
Ever.

695
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,751
I'm with you.

696
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,920
I'm behind you.

697
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:23,840
And I respect you.

698
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:31,890
I better get home.
Syl will be waiting up.

699
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,768
Good night, Dexter.

700
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:39,022
<i>When Harry saw
what I truly was, he was repulsed.</i>

701
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:40,732
<i>It destroyed my brother,</i>

702
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,151
<i>consumed Lila.</i>

703
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,737
<i>But not Miguel Prado.</i>

704
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,282
<i>Somehow he looks at me
and he's...</i>

705
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,076
<i>proud.</i>
