1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,294
<i>Previously on Dexter.</i>

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,380
I just got off the phone
with the Sheriff's Department.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,049
They've confirmed
their skinning victim is related to ours.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,884
That gives us three victims.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,054
I've got Unis bringing in
a 15-year-old kid named Wendell Owens.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,514
He was Freebo's doorman.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,975
But if things get really bad,
you use that card and call me, OK ?

8
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,603
You think I cut this kid loose
to make you look bad ?

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,398
I'm not sure any more...

10
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,066
partner.

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,235
You know a Joey Quinn ?

12
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,529
Cooperation with IA has its upside.

13
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,739
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,116
Ramon's obsessed.

15
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,410
He's not going to stop
looking for Oscar's killer

16
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,078
until it takes him all the way down.

17
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,080
- Is there a problem here ?
- Yeah, Sergeant.

18
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:41,249
Your people don't know
what the fuck they're doing.

19
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,459
That guy is wound way too tight.

20
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,920
Where ya been, Dexter ?

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,674
- How are you, Camilla ?
- Ah. I've been better.

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,219
Are you, uh, looking for
anything special tonight ?

23
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,138
Might be more than an hour.

24
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,017
Take a pass... Sergeant.

25
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,647
Anton, open up. It's me.

26
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,943
- Hi.
- Hi.

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,447
The Chicky Hines conviction.
My people have come across evidence

28
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:13,948
that could get the case reopened.

29
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,075
Prado know you're
coming to me with this ?

30
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,453
Don't you see what happened today ?

31
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,206
I gave you the chance to avenge
two women whom the system failed,

32
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,627
and just like I hoped,
you seized that opportunity.

33
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:31,007
I see who you are. I am with you.
Behind you.

34
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,260
And I respect you.

35
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,880
He's tired. Keep on reeling.
You got him.

36
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,756
Here he comes ! Come here !

37
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,758
Come here !

38
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,469
Oh, yeah ! Oh, shit !

39
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,764
Ah, ah.

40
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,435
- Ah... ah !
- Tranquilo. Coge.

41
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,520
That's gonna be some
mighty fine eatin'.

42
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,107
Hey, man, on the grill
with Syl's mango-and-lime salsa.

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,775
Our house tomorrow night.

44
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:59,322
Check with the little woman...
who's getting bigger as we speak.

45
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>I could get used to the simple joys
of male bonding.</i>

46
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,413
- Hey, how 'bout a... brewski ?
- OK.

47
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,790
Ah, that looks good.

48
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,127
So, Dex...

49
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,504
Ahh.

50
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,715
What was it like, man ?

51
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,425
In Bimini.

52
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,972
Flat, mostly. Lots of mangroves.

53
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,351
- Talking about Ethan Turner.
- What about him ?

54
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,437
What did it feel like to, uh...
take him out, hmm ?

55
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,856
To end his life.

56
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,111
<i>So much for the simple joys
of male bonding.</i>

57
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,449
<i>Like I could explain
or Miguel could understand.</i>

58
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,662
You put people on death row.
You must know what it's like.

59
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,830
Oh, no, but there's, like,
an ocean of bureaucracy

60
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,125
of briefs and appeals between me
and that bad guy taking his last breath.

61
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,338
I'm asking you what did it feel like
to use your hands, to...

62
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,840
to make this a better place ?

63
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,137
It felt... right.

64
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,225
Felt like justice.

65
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,356
I've got, like, five floors of prosecutors

66
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,026
and the whole police department at
my fingertips, and you did what I couldn't.

67
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,195
You came through for me, Dex.

68
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,490
I been sleepin' like a baby ever since.

69
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,704
It's hot today, huh ?

70
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,873
Like I said the other night,

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,375
I know you, Dexter.

72
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,377
I see who you are.

73
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,547
We're like-minded. Hmm ?

74
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,800
Together, we can make a difference.

75
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,012
<i>We ?</i>

76
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,557
<i>Miguel, my amigo, claims to know me.</i>

77
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,727
<i>On some level,
I suppose maybe that's true.</i>

78
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,603
Who are you kidding ?

79
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,650
He knows about Freebo.

80
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,695
He detailed me
to the Ethan Turner kill.

81
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,409
He's seen me with blood on my hands
and hasn't blinked.

82
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,204
Miguel's got no clue
what's really going on inside you.

83
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,873
The urge, the ritual.

84
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:18,044
Miguel has really gone out of his way
to understand who I am...

85
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,881
which is more than you ever did.

86
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:26,052
Well, I understood.
I just couldn't accept it.

87
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,722
And Miguel won't either.

88
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,641
You didn't want me to have any friends.

89
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,227
You think Miguel's a pal ?

90
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,730
Your wingman ?

91
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:41,067
You might wanna put
that notion to the test...

92
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,819
see how like-minded
you and Miguel really are.

93
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,785
Every time you let
someone get close,

94
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,495
it ends badly.

95
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,960
<i>I do need to consider
my spotty record connecting</i>

96
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,837
<i>with others.</i>

97
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,798
<i>But Miguel's not going away.</i>

98
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,883
<i>I need to make him
understand the risks.</i>

99
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,637
<i>When he does, he'll wanna rethink
the like-minded thing.</i>

100
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,559
<i>Just because he can gut a fish
doesn't qualify him to hang with me while I...</i>

101
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,436
<i>do what I do best.</i>

102
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,449
You need a jump ? I have cables.

103
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,204
Skinner struck again.

104
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,206
Super-hard this time.

105
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,875
The victim's name was Wendell Owen.
He was 15-years-old.

106
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,671
It's more collateral damage
in our search for fucking Freebo.

107
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,631
Wendell Owens ?

108
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,510
I brought him in
for questioning the other day.

109
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,679
I thought I remembered
hearing his name somewhere.

110
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,764
He might have been mixed up
with some lowlifes,

111
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,643
but Wendell was
a pretty decent kid.

112
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,105
Go do your thing.
I just need a minute.

113
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,327
Body's still warm. Putting time of death
about three hours ago.

114
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,246
Unlike the two previous victims,

115
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,707
this one died from
the skinning process itself.

116
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,292
Jesus Christ.

117
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,295
Freebo's probably in another galaxy,
and the Skinner doesn't even know it.

118
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,630
Meanwhile, he's stepping up his game.

119
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,550
Maybe we let the press know
Freebo got outta Dodge,

120
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,219
might get this guy
to put down his Ginsu knife.

121
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,721
Or he'll keep looking,

122
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,724
take his horror show on the road,
become somebody else's nightmare.

123
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,393
No, I wanna nail
whoever's doing this.

124
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,147
He's definitely not learning to do this
on the fly. He's had plenty of practice.

125
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,066
You run this through
the national database,

126
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,153
see if a similar MO
comes up anywhere else.

127
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,747
<i>What I need to find right now
is a target to present to Miguel</i>

128
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,083
<i>with a high degree
of difficulty and jeopardy.</i>

129
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,341
<i>So that he truly understands
that he's in way over his head.</i>

130
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,469
Dex. I have a question.

131
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,350
It's serious.
I can't ask any of the other cops.

132
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,478
- I'm all yours.
- It's about the Skinner.

133
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,439
His last two victims,
Wendell and Javier,

134
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,901
they were both killed
after I was done questioning them.

135
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,864
Do you think the Skinner's
drafting off my investigation ?

136
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,244
I don't know.
Anything's possible.

137
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,498
Because I'm freaking out that whoever's
looking for Freebo is using me to track him.

138
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,291
Who else knows you brought Wendell in ?

139
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,629
His mom, um...
all the cops in the station.

140
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,631
Anton.

141
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,549
Ramon Prado.

142
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,386
Miguel's brother.

143
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,598
The law and order hard-ass sheriff

144
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,185
who's been obsessed about finding Freebo
for killing his little brother ?

145
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,521
There's your motive.

146
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,649
Do we seriously think
that Ramon, a fellow cop,

147
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,776
could do something this sick ?

148
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,655
Like a career in law enforcement
precludes violent behavior ?

149
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,866
Can you imagine the shitstorm
this is gonna create if I'm wrong ?

150
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,619
It'll create a worse
shitstorm if you're right.

151
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,543
- Hey, keep me in the loop.
- Yeah.

152
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,380
Ramon's got anger issues.
I don't want you getting hurt.

153
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,341
Aw. You do care about me.

154
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,972
Wait till you see the wine cellar
at The Forge. It is legendary !

155
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,100
They even have a bottle
of Château d'Yquem...

156
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,519
belonged to Thomas Jefferson.

157
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,272
I'm kind of a Cuba Libre kinda girl myself.

158
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,609
Ellen, it's me. Nicely done.

159
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,945
Handing Miguel Prado
his head on a pike today -

160
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:59,575
make the Hines motion stick,
he could be disbarred. Bravissimo.

161
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,497
I was gonna talk to you about this,
if and when my motion's upheld.

162
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,877
How about we talk about it now ?

163
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,462
OK.

164
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:16,342
Miguel's been playing fast and loose
for a long time with legal ethics.

165
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,386
The Chicky Hines case
is just one example

166
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,555
on a very long list
of prosecutorial misconduct.

167
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,225
I came to you with information
to help your client,

168
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,855
not for you to trump up some witch-hunt
against my friend and colleague.

169
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,610
You can't possibly believe
he's either of those things

170
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,362
if you really knew Miguel.

171
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,280
Believe me, I know Miguel.

172
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,908
I will explain everything over dinner.

173
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,701
No, thanks.

174
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,914
I'm not feeling especially
social right now.

175
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,591
Hey.

176
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,386
Hope I'm not interrupting.

177
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,305
No, I'm alone. Come on in.

178
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,434
- Taking the night off ?
- Mm...

179
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,818
- So, um... beer ?
- Sure.

180
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,444
Pot ?

181
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,238
Fuck you.

182
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,994
Sounded kind of upset on the phone.

183
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,914
I'm kind of upset in person too.

184
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:35,587
Um... you didn't talk to anyone

185
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,923
about me bringing Wendell in
for questioning ?

186
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,052
No. I don't talk to anybody
about anything.

187
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,972
I try to keep the whole CI thing
under wraps, you know ?

188
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,724
Then how the hell did it get out ?

189
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,437
Well, it's a pretty safe bet
Wendell didn't tell anybody.

190
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,733
You should have seen
what this sicko did to him.

191
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,236
I'm glad I didn't.

192
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,157
What would make anyone go that hard
on some street kid, for Christ's sakes ?

193
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,867
There's this guy I'm lookin' at,

194
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,953
he's a cop who had a beef with Freebo.

195
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,582
He saw me in the station
when I was questioning Wendell.

196
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,876
Wouldn't be the first
time the boys in blue

197
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,211
handled their own business, right ?

198
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,509
I can't rule out that I put
Wendell in the crosshairs.

199
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,305
He trusted me enough
to cooperate and...

200
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,476
look what happened to him.

201
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,400
Hey, look...

202
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,613
even if you're right,

203
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,407
you couldn't have known, right ?

204
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,620
Don't beat yourself up.

205
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,043
It's what I do best, huh ?

206
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,097
I should go.

207
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,099
All right.

208
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,979
Hey, um...

209
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,398
Hey, look, um...

210
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,401
that girl from
the other night was...

211
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,237
was nothing serious.

212
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,908
Uh, well... it's none
of my business anyway.

213
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,535
Yeah, right.

214
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,705
Right.

215
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,207
Jenna Kendrick.

216
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,752
One of the first crime scenes
I worked blood spatter.

217
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,965
This was somebody's daughter.

218
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,011
And that was done to her
by this animal.

219
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,304
Clemson Galt.

220
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,139
Aryan affiliated.

221
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,101
Took a claw hammer to her
for getting pregnant.

222
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,979
He was arrested for murder,
even confessed to his cellmate.

223
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,106
He called it "hammer time".

224
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,399
They get a conviction ?

225
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,194
Galt's Aryan affiliates
either got witnesses to recant

226
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,447
or made them disappear.
Verdict came back not guilty.

227
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,117
That type of stuff happens way too often.

228
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:14,371
Galt's doing 15 to 20 for armed robbery
in a supermax upstate.

229
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,249
Well, that's something, at least.
Get him off the streets.

230
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,418
Only he's still running things
from his prison cell.

231
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,421
The wife and three kids
of an Aryan defector,

232
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,423
killed with a claw hammer.

233
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,928
While you're sleeping like a baby,
this is who's keeping me up nights.

234
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,183
<i>Justice comes at a price,</i>

235
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,312
<i>one that Miguel is about to discover
he can't afford.</i>

236
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,439
This asshole doesn't
deserve to breathe, OK ?

237
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:44,109
You're not gonna get
any argument with me about that.

238
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:48,113
But he's in custody.
In a supermax, no less.

239
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,282
That's always been the problem.

240
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,913
You're the big-deal law enforcement guy.
I bet you could get us access.

241
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,459
That's beyond dangerous, Dexter.
That's crazy !

242
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,336
<i>I knew if I appealed to reason,</i>

243
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:05,672
<i>Miguel would eventually
understand the downside.</i>

244
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,967
Never mind that my fingerprints
will be all over this !

245
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:14,348
<i>Reason leads to self-preservation,
a potent force.</i>

246
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,643
We both would be seriously
exposed here.

247
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,772
<i>I just need to sit back.</i>

248
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,858
<i>He'll see the pros are heavily
outweighed by the cons,</i>

249
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,694
<i>and we'll be back to mojitos
and barbecues.</i>

250
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,865
Yeah, when you get right down to it,

251
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,993
I guess Ethan Turner was
an accident of opportunity,

252
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,662
a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

253
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,498
What about Freebo ?

254
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,917
Another accident of opportunity ?

255
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,754
Well, that situation
just sort of... unfolded.

256
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,465
You're right.

257
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,677
We both have too much to lose.

258
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,430
Hey, we took out
the garbage... twice.

259
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,516
We should quit while we're ahead.

260
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,309
No.

261
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,232
I owe you this one, Dexter.
You stuck your neck out for me twice now.

262
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,192
- No, you don't owe me.
- Fair is fair.

263
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,236
And I won't let you down.

264
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,325
But we need to come up
with a real plan.

265
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,286
<i>Again... we.</i>

266
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,123
<i>Miguel surprised me last night.</i>

267
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,960
<i>I expected him to say no
and he gave me a definite maybe instead.</i>

268
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,129
Hey. No doughnuts today ?

269
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,256
Not today, Vince.

270
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,383
Talk about your passive aggressive.

271
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,428
<i>Clemson Galt has been
on my top ten list for years,</i>

272
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,304
<i>and Miguel could be a big help.</i>

273
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,598
<i>But the goal here
isn't to satisfy my need,</i>

274
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,309
<i>it's to get Miguel
to find some other hobby.</i>

275
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,020
Dexter. Got a minute ?

276
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,692
- Who's sick ?
- Uh, remember Camilla from records ?

277
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:52,487
She's in the hospital. It's not looking good,
so I got everyone to sign.

278
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,448
Camilla's sick ?

279
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,575
Sorry, I thought you knew.

280
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,744
Lung cancer. It's terminal.

281
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,412
Just like Gene.

282
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,205
Camilla's husband.

283
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,500
My folks used to play cards with them
when Deb and I were growing up.

284
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,336
He died just last year.
Lung cancer too.

285
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,756
- Smokers ?
- Chimneys.

286
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,177
- Life catches up.
- Yeah.

287
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,304
So does death.

288
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,473
It's a shame. She's a good person.

289
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,183
It sounds like she was a friend.

290
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,270
A good friend.

291
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,191
Those are in short supply these days.

292
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,902
Camilla's at Good Samaritan.
You could drop that off,

293
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,029
let her know she's in our prayers.

294
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,822
- I'll do that.
- Thanks.

295
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,494
Detective Gianna.
Sergeant Batista, Miami Metro Homicide.

296
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,329
How can I help you, Sergeant ?

297
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,166
I was, uh, wondering, Detective.

298
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,960
Maybe we could...

299
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,004
see each other.

300
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,965
As... As in a... a date ?

301
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,511
Well, yeah.
You could call it that.

302
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,889
Look, um, Sergeant,
let's be clear.

303
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,684
Cause being clear
will save us both a lot of agita.

304
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,021
Hey ! I, uh...

305
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,441
I don't date. Ever.

306
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,945
Do you eat... ever ?

307
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,365
Sometimes.

308
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,033
Good nutrition's important.

309
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,956
I'll tell you what, Sergeant.
I get hungry enough, I will call you.

310
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,591
Angel ?

311
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,220
What ?

312
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,014
Can I throw something at you
that might sound a little crazy ?

313
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,559
Crazy ? From you ?

314
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,812
- Ramon Prado.
- What about him ?

315
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,814
Do we like him for the Skinner ?

316
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,737
OK, that's not a little crazy.

317
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,074
He has access to all of our records,
so he knows exactly who I've been talking to.

318
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,577
And we've all seen him up close -
this is not a stable guy.

319
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,621
- He's a fucking whack job.
- I looked into his work schedule.

320
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,124
He was off duty
when the last two murders went down.

321
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,837
You seriously wanna look
at Ramon Prado for multiple homicide ?

322
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,881
If only to rule him out.

323
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,634
Not only have we not found the perp
that killed Miguel Prado's little brother,

324
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,430
now you wanna investigate
his other brother for murder ?

325
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,931
In a nutshell.

326
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,809
Can't ignore something
just cause it's messy.

327
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,270
If I'm right, this is huge.

328
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,856
And if you're wrong,
everyone involved will be shitting blood

329
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,649
due to acts I'd rather not describe.

330
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,568
Thanks for that, Sarge.

331
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,779
I've got a gut feeling.

332
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,616
You, uh, wanna go
to the Lieutenant with this ?

333
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,784
I can't go to LaGuerta with this.

334
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,582
You follow up, off the grid,

335
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,959
- and it's on you.
- Thank you, Sarge.

336
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,838
Ramon's off duty tonight and tomorrow.
I'll set up on him, see what shakes loose.

337
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,633
- If you need company...
- I've got it covered.

338
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,887
And try to be discreet, will you ?
For a change ?

339
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,139
Yeah.

340
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,796
Dexter.

341
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,382
You came.

342
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:44,344
I also brought you these.
But it looks like somebody beat me to it.

343
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,346
Oh, well...

344
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,224
a new mom in Maternity

345
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,893
donated them to Terminal Care.

346
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,147
Talk about irony, huh ?

347
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,489
You know, Dexter,

348
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:08,535
my whole life
I've been searching for...

349
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,124
The meaning of life ?

350
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,252
The perfect...

351
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,212
Key lime pie.

352
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,925
And what do I get
when I'm about to croak ?

353
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:30,223
Fucking pie crust, Reddi-wip,
and green Jell-O.

354
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,768
I'll see what I can do about finding you
the perfect Key lime pie.

355
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,062
You'd better do it fast.

356
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,858
Next thing to go is the appetite.

357
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,911
Gene always had this thing

358
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,622
about lighting my cigarette.

359
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,292
And he'd pass it to me...

360
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,379
before he lit his own.

361
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,634
Sweet, sweet man.

362
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:17,312
Then... Then it all caught up to him.

363
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,648
I watched him wither to a skeleton.

364
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:25,945
My six-foot tall,
200-pound husband,

365
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,865
shitting all over himself.

366
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,579
His last breath was a mercy.

367
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,967
Dying I can do.

368
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,637
Hell, I'm doing it.

369
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,973
The pain sure is a bear, though.

370
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,475
How bad ?

371
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,269
The worst part
of the whole damn thing...

372
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,481
not losing my life...

373
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:04,400
my time on this earth...

374
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,279
is losing my... my...

375
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,452
Dignity.

376
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:35,181
- Ah, that fish was great.
- You don't think Miguel overcooked it ?

377
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,560
A bit, but the mango salsa
saved the day.

378
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,520
Thank you.

379
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,274
So do you like what you do ?
I mean, real estate.

380
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,693
I can't imagine doing anything else.

381
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,947
Yeah, I decided
that losing my job at the hotel

382
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,825
is not a bad thing but a good thing.

383
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:56,369
So I'm looking around.

384
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,165
Well, with your people skills,
you'd be great at real estate.

385
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,499
You think ?

386
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,171
How 'bout you start work tomorrow ?

387
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,716
I'm... I'm sorry, what ?

388
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,385
I need an assistant.

389
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,264
Having someone I can trust
is everything.

390
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,268
Salud.

391
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,904
Listen, I've been giving a lot of thought
to this Clemson Galt thing.

392
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,240
Good.

393
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,408
Digame.

394
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:41,080
What if we were to travel upstate
and arrange an interview with him ?

395
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,957
About ?

396
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,168
A career criminal
with a record like his,

397
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,713
he's gotta be an encyclopedia of intel
on tons of other cases.

398
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:53,509
We would just need
to get Galt alone long enough

399
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,596
to make it look like
another prisoner did the deed.

400
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,723
Last week, an inmate is found

401
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,851
in a prison hallway
drowned in a bucket of water.

402
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,730
This stuff happens all day long
in places like that.

403
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,610
An inmate is found dead
in custody, Dexter,

404
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,695
you got inquiries and investigations.

405
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,114
You got the bleeding hearts
comin' outta the woodwork

406
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,866
whining about prison reform.

407
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,786
Ha. It doesn't sound
like much of a plan.

408
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,749
<i>That is the plan...</i>

409
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,710
<i>so that Miguel finally
includes himself out.</i>

410
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,712
But, um...

411
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,425
I'm in the middle of trying
a racketeering case right now.

412
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,094
Money laundering.

413
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,223
The Aryans, they're masters
at moving cash around.

414
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,811
I subpoena Galt
as an expert witness,

415
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,647
Corrections transports him
down here to testify.

416
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,483
Then Galt is within our reach, hmm ?

417
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,735
And on my turf.

418
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:57,490
I'm guessing it would take a long time
to set something like that up.

419
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,661
It would.

420
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,497
But I've already issued the subpoena.

421
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,666
Galt'll be here tomorrow night.

422
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:11,129
Only... he's gonna be a no-show
on the witness stand the next morning.

423
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,884
Swing by the courthouse tomorrow,
I'll walk you through all the details.

424
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,515
Coño, say thank you, Dexter.

425
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,809
<i>Miguel seems to have
way more aptitude</i>

426
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,730
<i>and appetite for this
than I ever imagined.</i>

427
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,450
Just calling to check in.

428
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,660
Just having a look-see
in Ramon Prado's car.

429
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,662
- Deb, you really need to...
- Relax.

430
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,123
He's scarfing down his second plate
of arroz con pollo

431
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:48,666
at a restaurant up the block.

432
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,210
He's got a wife and kids at home,
got the night off,

433
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,087
so why is he eating alone ?

434
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:58,009
Well, maybe the wife's arroz con pollo
isn't pollo enough.

435
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,178
You find anything interesting ?

436
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:02,555
A set of German steel filet knives,
a couple of straight razors,

437
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,640
and, like, 12 pounds of human skin.

438
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,101
Just be careful out there, will you ?

439
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,020
Yes, sir.

440
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:15,360
Deb's got her mission.
I've got mine.

441
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,590
Hey, I can get out
and give you a great big hug

442
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,675
so everyone can see
what good friends we are...

443
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,761
or you can talk to me.

444
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,223
You know, after 12 hours
on surveillance detail,

445
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,433
how 'bout you blow me instead ?

446
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,604
I've been given the directive to either step up
my investigation of Quinn or close it.

447
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,564
Because you haven't found dick.

448
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,026
If you weren't such a fuckwad, I'd almost
feel sorry for you for working for IA.

449
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,694
Where careers go to die.

450
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:01,364
You need to get next to Quinn,
be his go-to girl.

451
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,574
You'll be wearing a wire.

452
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,454
Are you on crack ? How many times
have I told you to eat shit ?

453
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,374
What the fuck makes you think
I'm suddenly willing to play now ?

454
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,584
Because if you don't,
I'll put the word out

455
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,753
that you've been cooperating all along.

456
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,673
Everyone'll think you're a rat anyway.

457
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,430
Hard to believe
even you would sink that low.

458
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,314
- So that door right over there ?
- Hmm.

459
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,777
Check this out. That's supposed
to be kept locked, and it never is.

460
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,489
The smokers use it
as a short cut to get outside.

461
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,908
Short cut to a shorter life.

462
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:49,454
You know, statistically, most escapes
happen out of a courthouse.

463
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,873
The security's a little bit more lax,

464
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,000
the defendant is wearing
a suit and a tie.

465
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,502
It makes it easy for him
to just walk away.

466
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,963
Easier for us to cover our tracks.

467
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,673
That too.

468
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,593
Señor, ¿ cuánto ?

469
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,595
- No, no, por favor.
- ¿ Está seguro ?

470
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,138
- Si, señor.
- Good, good !

471
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,265
Must be good to be you.

472
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,017
Sometimes.

473
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,894
Coño.

474
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,479
Thanks for helping out.

475
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,325
Real reason she's blindfolded -

476
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,410
so she doesn't have to watch
everything she stands for

477
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,787
get pissed on
by someone like Ellen Wolf.

478
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:34,040
You know, she had this client once

479
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,543
who threw a five-year-old
into an industrial washer for talking dirty.

480
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,338
She got him off with six months
in a mental hospital.

481
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,507
Diminished fucking capacity.

482
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,050
Hey.

483
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,845
She probably got paid more on that
than you took home in a year.

484
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,390
And I gotta tell you, I'm very disappointed
with your boss over there.

485
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,393
I never thought that she, of all people,
would hurt me like this

486
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,938
and throw in with these
fucking bottom feeders.

487
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,316
My dad used to say be careful
what you think you know about someone.

488
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,652
You're probably wrong.

489
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,280
Smart man.

490
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,617
Well, sometimes.

491
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,785
Maria !

492
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:16,249
I appreciate your, um, cooperation
in the deposition.

493
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,044
I've never had a problem
telling the truth.

494
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,507
We've got, uh, more than enough
to get the Hines conviction set aside.

495
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:28,469
And you've set the stage for your
smear campaign against a stand-up guy.

496
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,346
Nice.

497
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:34,100
You know, you ever wanna hear
the unexpurgated version of your guy,

498
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,227
come find me, OK ?

499
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,698
It's like a church.

500
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,241
Yeah.

501
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,204
The holding cell
is through that door.

502
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,165
Connects to a hallway,
then goes out to a parking garage.

503
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,544
On your right,
there's gonna be an emergency exit.

504
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,713
And that deadbolt
is gonna be taped...

505
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,090
open.

506
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,843
Why risk it all ?

507
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,762
Your career, reputation, freedom.

508
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,473
You could just walk away.

509
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,476
You didn't walk away
from Ethan Turner.

510
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,478
Because you understand, Dexter,

511
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,315
that we're living in...

512
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,941
we're living in crucial times,

513
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,445
crucial times that demand
extraordinary measures.

514
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,156
<i>Miguel's convinced himself</i>

515
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:33,826
<i>he wants this kill tonight
for lofty and noble reasons.</i>

516
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,620
<i>I'm not quite as high-minded.</i>

517
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,830
You didn't answer my question.

518
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,207
Asshole drunk dad...

519
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:44,462
maybe I'm still trying to clean up the mess
that I couldn't when I was a kid, I don't know.

520
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,132
Come on, I'll, uh,

521
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:51,093
show you where you're gonna
be hooking up with Galt.

522
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,977
Morgan, what's the hurry ?

523
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,314
- You meeting someone ?
- More like avoiding someone.

524
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,525
Hey, this is me not telling you
I'm tailing Ramon Prado again tonight.

525
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,362
Well, this is me not hearing
a word you're saying.

526
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:13,032
I'm also unofficially and off the record
telling you to be smart and watch your ass.

527
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,619
Excuse me, Officer.

528
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,746
Sergeant. How can I help you ?

529
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,831
I was just, uh...

530
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:24,001
...released for this legal thing.

531
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:28,297
- You were arrested.
- And released. Totally victimless.

532
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:33,052
Only I live, like, a million miles
away from here, and I really need a ride.

533
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,888
How 'bout the bus ?

534
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,974
How 'bout you take me home

535
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,977
and I think of some victimless way
of saying thank you ?

536
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,407
I'll have Dispatch call you a cab.

537
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,534
Just like that ?

538
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,160
Just like that.

539
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,763
Agent Batista.

540
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,891
Sergeant, Barbara Gianna here.

541
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:24,437
So happens, uh...

542
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,938
I'm hungry.

543
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,692
Hungry enough to...
to see if you are too.

544
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,944
Are you asking me out
on a date, Detective ?

545
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,823
I don't date, Sergeant. Ever.

546
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,242
Marino's Trattoria, 7:30 ?

547
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:41,787
Aren't you gonna ask me
if I really turned over a new leaf ?

548
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,124
It could be I'm just not
partial to redheads.

549
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,960
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Detective.

550
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,212
I'll see you at 7:30.

551
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:58,721
Delivered fresh daily
from a little bakery down in Key Largo.

552
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,807
Supposed to be the best in the Keys.

553
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,350
Well, it's not.

554
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:05,644
Pardon my bluntness, but...

555
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,354
this pie is green.

556
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,815
Means they used food coloring.

557
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,942
Something purists frown on ?

558
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:16,322
Which I'd be doing right now,
except even my face hurts.

559
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,699
The other thing they fucked up -

560
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,827
this wasn't made
with condensed milk.

561
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,330
No, it's fresh and organic.

562
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,666
Only they didn't have
fresh milk in the Keys

563
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,002
back in the day.

564
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,128
Oh.

565
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,007
Here comes Miss Morphine.

566
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:39,094
Bringer of bad dreams
and less pain.

567
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,639
Dexter.

568
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:46,811
If you're as serious
about Key lime pie as I am...

569
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,608
you can do better.

570
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,698
<i>Tonight's the night.
But it feels different.</i>

571
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:05,746
<i>I won't be alone. Uncharted territory
for me, not without risk.</i>

572
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,832
<i>And strangely exhilarating.</i>

573
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,000
So, what do you think ?

574
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,671
Best pizza night ever.

575
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,091
No, I meant about Syl's job offer.

576
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:21,136
If real estate's something you're
interested in, I think you should go for it.

577
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:23,889
And Syl's great at what she does.

578
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,517
In a market this bad,
she's still always closing.

579
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,853
And I could learn a lot, I just...

580
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,772
But ?

581
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,068
Well, what if I...

582
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,070
see a side to her that I don't like ?

583
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,905
I guess that's the risk you run

584
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,868
when you go into business
with somebody, especially a friend.

585
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:47,496
Makes things more complicated,
no doubt about it.

586
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:52,001
Still... without my friend Syl,
I wouldn't have this opportunity.

587
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:57,423
So I think I'm gonna take the risk
and jump in with both feet

588
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:01,135
and see if this new thing calls to me.

589
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,225
- It's getting late.
- You don't wanna stay ?

590
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:12,438
Miguel and I have a...
early morning run.

591
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,940
I can sleep in longer
if I stay at my place.

592
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,152
Don't be surprised if he's a no-show.

593
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,237
What makes you say that ?

594
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,324
He's been a complete wreck lately.

595
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,825
Not sleeping, terrible mood.

596
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,120
I mean, Syl thinks something's
really bothering him.

597
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,830
I saw him today. He seemed fine.

598
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,416
Well, you may be his buddy,
but you're not his wife.

599
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:36,837
And besides, it's not like you can hide
anything from your partner.

600
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,964
So true.

601
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,842
Why would you want to ?

602
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,723
<i>Looks like Miguel's
got a bad case of nerves about tonight.</i>

603
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,975
<i>He isn't sleeping
like a baby any more.</i>

604
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,938
If you're gonna bail out of this,
now would be a good time.

605
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,359
What the hell are you
dressed like that for ?

606
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:01,320
I figured the more the merrier.

607
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,490
Why don't we swing by
and pick up Rita and the kids ?

608
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,661
Bring them along too.

609
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,165
What makes you think
you can count on Miguel ?

610
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,793
He's just a little jumpy.
He's new at this.

611
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:19,588
Mark my words, Dex, he'll give you up
in a heartbeat to save his own ass.

612
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:23,550
This is not a guy who wants to spend
the rest of his life in a cage.

613
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:27,221
Just one more thing
Miguel and I have in common.

614
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,515
You don't know
what you're getting into.

615
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,018
You've never had to rely
on anyone else before, Dexter.

616
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,355
Because you taught me
loneliness is an art form.

617
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,734
But guess what, I finally have a life

618
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,570
with a family and now a friend...

619
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,198
who I trust.

620
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,493
We only see two things in people...

621
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,579
what we wanna see
and what they wanna show us.

622
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:54,999
You don't know Miguel
any more than he knows you.

623
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,543
You aren't seriously gonna
lecture me on relationships

624
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,504
after the debris field you left behind.

625
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,801
No matter how close
two people are,

626
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,178
an infinite distance separates them.

627
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,141
Look at you and me.

628
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,068
Mind if I get a picture with you, jefe ?

629
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,863
- You got a cam... Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

630
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,034
No hayproblema. Tiralo.

631
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,374
Gracias.

632
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,210
Any truth you're gonna run for DA ?

633
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,921
Uh... if I do,
I'm gonna need your support.

634
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:45,299
You got it, jefe.

635
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,473
Thanks, Officer.

636
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,359
You listen to me, pulled pork.

637
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:07,321
I got no clue why the fuck
you dragged me down here

638
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,448
in all this humidity,
but you can suck my white dick,

639
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,950
you think I'm helping
your spic ass with shit.

640
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,374
This all ends right here,
right now, Clemson.

641
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,961
This makes us even.

642
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,723
When you walk out the door,

643
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,310
one of your Nazi pals is waiting for you
in the parking garage.

644
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,562
From now on,

645
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,815
all of the threats to my family,

646
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,900
they stop, understand ?

647
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,539
I knew my Aryan brothers
would come through, ese.

648
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,430
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

649
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,558
Hey, have any arrangements
been made

650
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,936
in case this guy's testimony runs a little long
and he has to stay another day ?

651
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,772
We're holding a spot for him
in protective at Miami-Dade.

652
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,732
Good man. Appreciate it.

653
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,196
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

654
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,032
I got a witness in there, man,
that's taking a nap.

655
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,702
I'm gonna really need him fresh for court
in a couple of hours.

656
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,621
I gotta put a county wristband on him.
Just take a second.

657
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,802
Clem Galt.

658
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,680
I'm your wheel man.

659
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,892
Welcome home.

660
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,602
Heil Hitler.

661
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,062
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Ride's this way.

662
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,231
Have you out of the country
by lunch time.

663
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,566
Fuck !

664
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,611
- Shit ! What's going on here ?
I don't know. Come on.

665
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:18,410
I'll get you outta here.
We just gotta get to the car.

666
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,078
Galt had to have an accomplice.

667
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,874
Just set up a perimeter around this building
right away. No one should get in or out.

668
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,502
- Fuckin' spic set us up.
- This guy cannot get away !

669
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,297
- And I'm gonna return the favor.
- That's mighty white of you.

670
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,350
Galt's right.
He's selling you out.

671
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,479
Never underestimate the capacity
of other people to let you down.

672
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,481
It's not the time, Dad.

673
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,445
There he goes.

674
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,739
Looking out for number one.

675
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,659
Which is what you should have done.

676
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,667
Like the man said,

677
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,877
nobody gets in or out.

678
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,717
Might as well give up.

679
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,636
No sense risking death by cop.

680
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:21,056
If you keep Miguel's involvement secret,
he might let you off with a few years.

681
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,224
Stop.

682
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,977
Unless they find those blood slides
when they toss your apartment.

683
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,937
Stop !

684
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,524
Hola, amigo.

685
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,252
I'm gonna drop you off at your car.

686
00:43:50,378 --> 00:43:54,381
Then I'll meet you at the stash house
as soon as I can get outta here.

687
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,093
- Wait for me, huh ?
- Thanks for this.

688
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,345
That's what friends are for.

689
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,182
Hey, I'm gonna do a loop
around the building

690
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,143
until you get more backup here, OK ?

691
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,894
You got it, jefe.

692
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,367
Gimme a fucking break, Ramon.

693
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,579
Don't fucking lie to me !

694
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:26,830
Aah !

695
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,061
You can make this stop right now...

696
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,729
if you tell me where he is.

697
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,981
I don't know.

698
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,695
You're making this
very hard on yourself, Felipe.

699
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:06,745
Whoa.

700
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,663
You scared the fuckmother out of me.

701
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,583
You're the one that called me.
What do we got ?

702
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,086
Kidnapping, for starters.

703
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,798
- Who's the special guest ?
- That's Felipe Cepeda.

704
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,926
He's one of Freebo's hemp suppliers.
I questioned him a couple of weeks ago.

705
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,845
Now Ramon's got a few
questions of his own for him.

706
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,057
Well, so far, I've only heard one -
"where's Freebo ?"

707
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,393
I'm just waiting for the skinning to start.

708
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,605
Oye. Tell me where he is.

709
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,065
I don't know !

710
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,650
OK.

711
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,569
OK.

712
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,868
Nothing like a nice cold soda pop
before a good skinning.

713
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,999
Aah !

714
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:54,668
Fuck, that's gotta hurt.

715
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,253
- Wait, wait.
- Wait ?

716
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,213
We need to be sure he's the Skinner.

717
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,263
Felipe...

718
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,724
you have some answers for me now ?

719
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,897
I don't get it. I don't get it.

720
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,025
- That's not the Skinner's MO.
- Maybe he's just warming up.

721
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,200
Here he goes.

722
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:37,711
Vete.

723
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,384
He's not the Skinner.

724
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,034
I gotta take this. Don't go anywhere.

725
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,203
Hello.

726
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,288
So Ramon Prado's a sick fuck,

727
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,999
but he's not the sick fuck
we're looking for.

728
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,628
I'll talk to you about it over breakfast.
I gotta go.

729
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:21,213
What's up ?

730
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,925
So, why are you calling us in
at midnight ?

731
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,512
We've picked up Ramon Prado.

732
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:31,014
He's, uh... outside.

733
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,892
We got a Uni watching him
to keep his mouth shut.

734
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:37,437
For what ?

735
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:40,440
Kidnapping. False imprisonment.

736
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,026
And torture.

737
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,244
- Are you sure ?
- We witnessed it ourselves.

738
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:58,333
- My God, I...
- We can't give him a pass on this.

739
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,918
I...

740
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,920
Shit.

741
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,922
No, we can't.

742
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,345
Thank you for being politic at least.

743
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,807
I woulda perp-walked him
right through here.

744
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:17,352
Morgan insisted we be discreet
out of respect for his family.

745
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,318
Were you aware
of this investigation ?

746
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,572
- Yes, I was.
- And you didn't inform me ?

747
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:32,242
I wanted something solid
before involving you.

748
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,663
Thank you for that.

749
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:40,208
Morgan, you handled
a tough situation the smart way.

750
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,627
How do you wanna do this ?

751
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,796
Book him.

752
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,882
I'll notify the family.

753
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,100
That went well.

754
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,404
Internal Affairs
is investigating you.

755
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,407
What ?

756
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,285
They've been giving me
a sandpaper enema to wear a fucking wire.

757
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,203
- This has been going on for a while.
- Yes.

758
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,497
- And you're finally telling me.
- I'm finally telling you.

759
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,667
Do you wanna tell me why this IA chick
is so gung ho to bring you down ?

760
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:28,214
Wait. Does this IA chick
go by the name of Yuki Amado ?

761
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:30,842
As a matter of fact, yes.

762
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,054
You wanna tell me what's going on ?

763
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,557
Yeah. Yuki and I have a... history.

764
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,852
It's a totally personal vendetta on her part.

765
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,147
I'll handle it.

766
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,066
I appreciate the heads-up, though.

767
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,749
Even in prison, I'm sure
you heard about the big slump

768
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,626
in the real-estate market.

769
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,714
What the fuck ?

770
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:14,594
Shit !

771
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,348
There is an upside
to the downturn, though.

772
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,558
Plenty of empty houses.

773
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,648
Do you recognize this one ?

774
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,150
It's where you killed Jenna Kendrick.

775
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,736
I got no idea what the hell
you're talking about.

776
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:35,407
I'm talking about hammer time, Clemson.

777
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,743
No.

778
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,538
You got me mixed up
with somebody else.

779
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,759
You can't imagine how much
I've been looking forward to this.

780
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,889
And none of it
would be happening

781
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:04,060
if it weren't for my... friend...

782
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:07,063
Miguel Prado. You remember him ?

783
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,065
He really came through tonight.

784
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,901
In a big way.

785
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,949
<i>I never had a partner before.</i>

786
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:21,953
<i>I had my doubts initially,
but everything worked out.</i>

787
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,582
<i>But this part, the ritual...</i>

788
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,169
<i>the connection and certainty...</i>

789
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:32,505
<i>followed by that pristine silence...</i>

790
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,593
<i>is for me.</i>

791
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,474
<i>And me alone.</i>

792
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,784
<i>Miguel will be disappointed.</i>

793
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,288
<i>I'll explain to him I took Galt
straight to the cemetery</i>

794
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,625
<i>and dumped him in a grave
after the screw-up at the courthouse.</i>

795
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,086
<i>Truth is, I'm not ready
to share this part of me</i>

796
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,339
<i>with anyone else just yet.</i>

797
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,760
<i>Present company excepted.</i>

798
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:22,722
<i>I'm not sure I ever will be ready.</i>

799
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,563
<i>Even if Miguel senses my deception,</i>

800
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,691
<i>he'll forgive me this one small untruth.</i>

801
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,361
<i>Dexter.</i>

802
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,326
<i>How can I be so sure ?</i>

803
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:52,085
<i>Because after tonight,
I can honestly say</i>

804
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,046
<i>I know who Miguel Prado really is...</i>

805
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,758
<i>my first good friend.</i>

806
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,596
<i>And those are in short supply
these days.</i>
