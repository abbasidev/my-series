1
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,471
<i>Last season on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,517
The butchered bodies were
submerged inside these garbage bags...

3
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,144
Did you hear that ?
30 bags. Do you know what that means ?

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,979
There might be
a new mass murderer out there

5
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,482
- way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.
- Uh-oh.

6
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,360
Eight confirmed victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

7
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,904
That's what the press is calling
whoever dumped those bodies offshore.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,281
Last thing Miami needs
is another serial killer.

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,327
- Any idea who the FBI is sending ?
- Some guy named Lundy.

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,080
We have positive IDs
on all 18 of our complete bodies.

11
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,834
All 13 were either tried for murder
or at least suspected of murder.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,337
Bay Harbor Butcher ? Give me one
shot, I'd put a bullet in the fucker's head.

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,547
You really feel that way ?

14
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,757
If Dad taught us one thing,
it's the value of human life.

15
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,176
<i>Yeah, but I think we had
different homework assignments.</i>

16
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,307
Tell me the truth.
Are you an addict ?

17
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,851
Yes, I have an addiction.

18
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,769
- I'm Dexter.
- Hi, Dexter.

19
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,896
There's my sponsor.

20
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,859
So tell me, exactly how full of shit are you ?

21
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,527
<i>This woman sees me.</i>

22
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,697
<i>Somehow she's able to make me feel OK
about what I am.</i>

23
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,409
You're going to tell me
all your deepest, darkest secrets.

24
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,579
Laura Moser, my mother,
she was murdered.

25
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,789
I've never told anyone that before.

26
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,626
Did you find out what happened to the
men responsible for your mother's murder ?

27
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,547
Santos Jimenez. Turned state's evidence,
went into witness protection.

28
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,591
- Where are you ?
- I've decided to look up

29
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,050
someone from my past.

30
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,927
1976 !

31
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,097
You slaughtered her
cause she stole cocaine.

32
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,975
She was a snitch for a cop.
She was fucking him.

33
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:45,188
<i>It seems my foster father and
my biological mother were having an affair.</i>

34
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:48,566
<i>Did he blame himself for her death ?
Is that why he took me in ?</i>

35
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,235
<i>Or was he just using her ?
Was he using me ?</i>

36
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,280
But there ain't no paper trail
on the early years of Dexter Morgan.

37
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,866
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,619
Back... off.

39
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,370
Ow ! Fuck !

40
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,084
If Dexter files a complaint,
you will be kicked off the force.

41
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,295
He's hiding something, Maria.
I can feel it.

42
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,963
I need some blood slides analyzed.

43
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,424
I'm about to be found out
at work for what I really am.

44
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,302
- You don't understand.
- Why don't you make me ?

45
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,937
- Who the fuck are you ?
- Oh, pardon my tits.

46
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,398
How could you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids ?

47
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,776
You and Lila
stayed in a hotel together.

48
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,736
It's over, Dexter.

49
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:38,366
I'm sure that you heard we have a suspect
in the Bay Harbor Butcher case.

50
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,784
Sergeant James Doakes.

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,285
He had the slides.

52
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,788
Carefully hidden in the trunk of his car
at the airport.

53
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,499
Jesus Christ, Morgan.
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

54
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,918
You sure about that ?
You might want to check with Lundy.

55
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,343
What's it gonna be, Morgan ?
Kill me now or set me free !

56
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,762
Don't worry,
I'll send the FBI your way soon enough.

57
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,264
So you're still gonna try to frame me ?

58
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,890
Mission accomplished.

59
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,143
After tomorrow, I'll be out of reach.
Permanently.

60
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,729
- You're going somewhere ?
- Goodbye, Lila.

61
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:15,236
Welcome. Previous
destinations. Starting route guidance.

62
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,905
Hey ! Who's out there ?
Anybody out there ?

63
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,032
- Who put you in there ?
- His name is Dexter Morgan.

64
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,202
I found out that he's the Bay Harbor Butcher.
Please, just open this gate !

65
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,497
- Poor thing, all alone.
- I'm OK.

66
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,292
Not you. Dexter.

67
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:36,173
What the fuck are you doing ? Turn that off !
Do you understand this is murder ?

68
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,852
- What were you thinking ? Are you insane ?
- I was trying to bring us back together.

69
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,313
<i>The Lila experiment
is officially over.</i>

70
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,148
Could have had it all, Dexter.

71
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,747
<i>I've never put much weight
into the idea of a higher power,</i>

72
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>but if I didn't know better,</i>

73
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,711
<i>I'd have to believe that some force out there
wants me to keep doing what I'm doing.</i>

74
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:17,214
You wanted to be close to me, Lila ?
This is the most I have to offer.

75
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,884
You taught me to accept what I am.

76
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,345
Thank you.

77
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,223
<i>The code is mine now
and mine alone.</i>

78
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,435
<i>So too are the relationships I cultivate.</i>

79
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,689
<i>My father might not approve,
but I'm no longer his disciple.</i>

80
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,274
<i>I'm a master now.</i>

81
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,904
<i>An idea transcended into life.</i>

82
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,312
<i>Ah, life.</i>

83
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,439
<i>Life is a ritual.</i>

84
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:39,648
<i>Routine.</i>

85
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,901
<i>Control.</i>

86
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,654
<i>And an essential part of that routine...</i>

87
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,366
<i>regular oral hygiene.</i>

88
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,290
There we go.
A few minutes, that'll numb right up.

89
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,127
So how was your summer, Dexter ?

90
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,004
I went to the carnival.

91
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,510
I even won a prize.

92
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,512
Hope you stayed away
from all the sweet stuff.

93
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,724
Usually I'm good,
but sometimes I indulge.

94
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,021
I also made it a point to meet new people.

95
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,275
Can never have too many friends.

96
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,903
Now, this temporary crown
is gonna go way in the back.

97
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,072
So there may be some blood.

98
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,574
- Not a problem.
- OK.

99
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,577
- So you still have your boat ?
- Oh, you bet.

100
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,081
It's the only place
I can really let everything go.

101
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,001
That's great. I'm gonna have you up
and out on that water in no time.

102
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,525
<i>For someone who needs to spend his life
pretending to be normal,</i>

103
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,903
<i>I've been able to finally settle in...</i>

104
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,199
<i>...to a nice, normal world.</i>

105
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,017
<i>And Rita is the scaffolding
that holds that world in place.</i>

106
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,227
What are you thinking ?

107
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,649
Life is good.

108
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,942
Hmm.

109
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,245
Here you go, buddy. OK, Astor, you're up.
Mickey Mouse, unicorns or starfish ?

110
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,623
Just plain, round pancakes, Dexter.

111
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,668
She's growing up.

112
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,795
It starts with pancakes ?

113
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,631
It starts when it starts.

114
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,007
Hey, Dexter ?

115
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,970
Um, can you come to Dad Day
at my school tomorrow ?

116
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,809
Just tell me what to do.

117
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,031
There's Charlotte.

118
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,825
- Bye, Mom. See you, Dexter.
- Bye, Mom.

119
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,661
- Bye.
- Get your bag.

120
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,880
You hear that ?

121
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,008
Hear what ?

122
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,511
The calm.

123
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,599
Everything's falling into place
for the first time in my life.

124
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,018
I've got these terrific kids.

125
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,105
There's no more drama haunting me.

126
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:11,026
And I have this great,
generous, gentle guy.

127
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:20,577
<i>Most normal people
enjoy a sacred pact with society -</i>

128
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,789
<i>live a good life
and society will take care of you.</i>

129
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:28,335
<i>But if society drops the ball,
then someone else has to pick up the slack.</i>

130
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,838
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

131
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,215
<i>Fred Bowman, AKA Freebo.</i>

132
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:36,927
<i>Kills two college girls
and skates on a state police screw-up,</i>

133
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,596
<i>otherwise known as Florida's
catch and release program.</i>

134
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:44,935
<i>He does the deed, gets away with murder
and falls off the radar.</i>

135
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,729
<i>Everyone's radar but mine.</i>

136
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,817
<i>You got a birthday coming up, Dad.</i>

137
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,778
<i>What to get the man
who had everything ?</i>

138
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,198
<i>How about... Freebo ?</i>

139
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,293
- Morning, Dex.
<i>- Dexter the doughnut guy.</i>

140
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,878
<i>Part of my routine.</i>

141
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,257
<i>But let the record show
I'm not the only one with a daily ritual.</i>

142
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,093
<i>Angel Batista - bear claw.</i>

143
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,764
<i>Vince Masuka - lemon custard.</i>

144
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,478
Mmm, better than sex.

145
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,272
Actually, no, it's not.

146
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,735
Hey, I need a favor. Do you think
you can proof an article I'm writing for FQ ?

147
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,779
- Forensics Quarterly.
- Right, yeah.

148
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,157
- They reached out cause I was the LFI...
- Lead forensic investigator.

149
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,825
- ... on the BHB.
- Bay Harbor Butcher.

150
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,993
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,747
- No biggie. I've been published before.
- "Dear Penthouse" doesn't count.

152
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:51,168
- Hey, that letter was famous.
- Death by pastry.

153
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,670
You changed your hair.

154
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,298
- Makes you look younger.
- I don't wanna look younger.

155
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,010
Bad call, then. By the way,
nice work on the Rinaldi case.

156
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,555
Yeah, well, murder-suicide.
Pretty straightforward.

157
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,600
Well, still, I mean,
your report was spot-on, right ?

158
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,148
All right.

159
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,152
Quinn's been in Homicide two weeks
and he noticed.

160
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,613
- Noticed what ?
- My hair.

161
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,076
I changed my hairstyle
for the first time since I was eight.

162
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,580
Oh, yeah. It's short... er. Shorter.

163
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,877
- Quinn, he's showing off his detective skills.
- You think he thinks I'm a potential lay ?

164
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:38,090
That is not happening. As long as you're
not noticing things, you've also not noticed

165
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:43,137
that I've given up men, liquor and smokes
for the last 27 days.

166
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,181
This is you remembering
Dad's birthday though, right ?

167
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,766
Dad. Birthday. Right.

168
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,269
Blue room, 7:30, like always.

169
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,650
- I tried calling you last night.
- I, uh, wasn't home.

170
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:03,323
I also tried your cell phone. You're wearing
the same pants you had on yesterday.

171
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,950
That shirt's the backup
you keep in your locker.

172
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,620
Ayúdeme aqui. I thought part
of your restructuring our department

173
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,248
was you staying out of our personal lives.

174
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,584
Anything you want me to know ?

175
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,422
Know this. I went out and had a great time
last night, and you should be happy for me.

176
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,133
Besides, since when do you care ?

177
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,679
Since this. Follow me.

178
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,353
OK, guys, listen up.

179
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,816
I just got word from upstairs that

180
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,778
Angel will no longer be
Detective Batista.

181
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,530
What ?

182
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,952
In two days,
he will be Detective Sergeant Batista.

183
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:56,585
Sorry for all the red tape and the hoops.
Nobody deserves it more than you, Angel.

184
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,922
When this is really official...

185
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:06,428
when I can trade this in for that gold badge...
drinks are on me.

186
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,522
Angel gets his wings.
Know what this means ?

187
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,815
Pay raise ?

188
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,527
No, dildo, it means he's my supervisor

189
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:25,113
which means I'm a lock
for my detective shield.

190
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,242
- Where are you going ?
- Research.

191
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:33,372
Dex. Typos, grammar,
something could be clearer, whatever.

192
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,958
Haircut ?

193
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,795
Yep.

194
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,178
<i>Time to get the lay of the land
on Freebo and his...</i>

195
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,138
<i>pink house.</i>

196
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,658
What you need ?

197
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,662
Freebo. I need Freebo.

198
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,875
- And you know him how ?
- He sells the best shit anywhere.

199
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,713
Come on, man, what,
you Google him or something ?

200
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,256
Know what ? Fuck it.

201
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,633
- There's other dope spots.
- Hey, come here !

202
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,844
Don't walk away all "fuck you" on me.

203
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,273
- What ?
- Ding, ding.

204
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,667
I'm looking to hold some product.

205
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:08,216
Ordinarily, I don't accept new clientele,
but I've had a desultory third quarter.

206
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,885
Mmm !

207
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,553
Oh, come on !

208
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,266
Need a little more hook
before breaking to the pocket.

209
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:23,190
You know, I bought this TV for six grand
but I'll let you have it for three.

210
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,984
More interested in scoring some tar.

211
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,945
Oh, another yuppie turns to the dark side.

212
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,451
- I need a hit.
- Jeez, Teegan, I'm transacting here.

213
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,371
- One toot.
- Did you hear what I said ?

214
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,456
Fuck off, Teegan.

215
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,502
Fine, I guess your dick
can suck itself from now on.

216
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,301
Stupid cunt's gonna
redefine "short-term relationship".

217
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,305
- Catch my drift ?
- Yeah, I catch your drift.

218
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,308
<i>And I'm entirely confident
you've earned the privilege</i>

219
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,894
<i>of being repurposed as fish food.</i>

220
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,445
<i>Narcotics raided this place
at noon today.</i>

221
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,285
<i>The drug rats won't return
to their nest for a while.</i>

222
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,508
<i>Plenty of time
to do what I have to do.</i>

223
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,474
Raw. You like it raw.

224
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:45,230
- Excuse me ?
- The sugar. You like the raw stuff.

225
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,859
It's my job to notice things.
Morgan, right ?

226
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,112
- Do I know you ?
- New haircut. It's cute.

227
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:57,784
- All right, who the fuck are you ?
- Yuki Amado, Internal Affairs.

228
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,703
And ?

229
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,332
- You know a Joey Quinn ?
- Why ?

230
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:09,337
Well, he started drawing our attention
back when he was in Narcotics.

231
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,214
He's in your orbit now.

232
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,341
I don't know the guy
except to hand in my paperwork.

233
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,803
Be really cool if you could
get next to him, you know ?

234
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,723
- Do a little recon.
- Are you high ?

235
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,683
No, never been.

236
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,185
Well...

237
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,146
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

238
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:30,025
Cooperation with IA
has its upside in the department.

239
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,068
- Yeah, maybe for rodents.
- OK.

240
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,783
Well, it was nice to finally meet you.
In person, you know.

241
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,534
Bye.

242
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,788
And what is it
you think Quinn did exactly ?

243
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:47,918
Mm ! Mm-mm. You don't get
to blow me off and still ask questions.

244
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,263
<i>Loud music.
Cover of darkness.</i>

245
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,810
<i>Perfect.</i>

246
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,930
Get off ! No !

247
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,354
Freebo, get back here !

248
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,291
- Who are you ?
- Who are you ?

249
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,338
Shit ! Oh !

250
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,718
Yo, Freebo, man.

251
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,105
<i>What the fuck happened back there ?</i>

252
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:36,943
<i>I went to kill Freebo
and ended up killing a total stranger.</i>

253
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,779
<i>I've never killed anyone
I didn't completely vet before,</i>

254
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,699
<i>whose guilt I wasn't absolutely certain of.</i>

255
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:47,454
<i>I did something wholly inside the moment
and wholly outside the code.</i>

256
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,001
<i>Something spontaneous.</i>

257
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,212
<i>Who did I just kill ?</i>

258
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,549
<i>Freebo's doorman.</i>

259
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,510
<i>I... am... fucked.</i>

260
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,807
<i>Just a matter of time
before someone calls it in.</i>

261
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,648
- Hey, you.
- Dexter, hey.

262
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,903
I know it's not one of our regular nights
but... can you come over ?

263
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,447
Uh, sure. Everything OK ?

264
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:27,619
Yeah. Just...
Just missing you, that's all.

265
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,750
God, you're on fire lately.

266
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,379
Are you complaining ?

267
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,799
I'm complying.

268
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,685
Where are you ?

269
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,270
I'm right here.

270
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,608
In a safe place.

271
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:09,285
God created pudding
and then He rested.

272
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,332
Pudding of chocolate.

273
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,209
Manna from heaven.

274
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,716
What are the kids gonna do
for dessert tomorrow ?

275
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,385
Tangerines.

276
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,982
Dexter Morgan.

277
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,695
Yes, I'm happy
with my long-distance provider.

278
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:50,326
What the hell ever happened
to "do not call" ? It's three in the morning.

279
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,370
Not in India.

280
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,710
I have an insanely busy morning
tomorrow,

281
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,088
so I'll be gone
before you and the kids wake up.

282
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,343
Dexter, you've been working
such killer hours lately.

283
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,596
Just hold me till you have to go.

284
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,990
Just a matter of time.

285
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,583
Morning, Sergeant.

286
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,503
How long for you to get
to 118 Calendar ?

287
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,589
Um, 20, 30 minutes.

288
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,853
- I got it, Dex.
- Got what ?

289
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,356
Only the case that's
gonna get me my shield. It's huge.

290
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,775
Angel put me on it. Officially on it.

291
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,735
Huge ?

292
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,830
- Who the hell are you ?
- Bet you're wondering who the hell he is.

293
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:21,251
Who he is is what makes this case huge.
That's Miguel Prado.

294
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:25,463
He's that ADA who's been on a mission
to put away as many bad guys as he can.

295
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:29,092
You know ?
"A safe Miami is the only Miami. "

296
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,678
A safe Miami
and we're all unemployed.

297
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,974
Why's he look so familiar ?

298
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,434
He just made
the cover of Florida magazine.

299
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:41,563
Top prosecutor in the state
three years in a row.

300
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,774
He and LaGuerta go way back.
You know, that whole cubano thing.

301
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,653
The other guy is Ramon Prado,
Miguel's middle brother.

302
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,947
He's a lieutenant
with the sheriff's department.

303
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:54,534
Made himself quite the reputation
for being a law-and-order hard-ass.

304
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,077
And...

305
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,454
Oscar.

306
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,916
- Prado ?
- As in "baby brother".

307
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,628
<i>So much for spontaneity.</i>

308
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,922
What was he doing in a dump like this ?

309
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,592
They're saying he was
a coach at a youth club.

310
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:14,637
Came here to confront the scumbag
about selling shit to his kids.

311
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:19,475
- Talk about wrong place at the wrong time.
- Tell me about it.

312
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,568
- Find anything ?
- Yeah.

313
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,405
Dead guy with a hole in his chest.

314
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,502
This window's cracked
and there's blood on the wall.

315
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,047
- Who shut these drapes ?
- Probably the first on scene.

316
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,008
Some dipshit rookie
who's still outside puking.

317
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,652
So what do we got ?

318
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:16,532
Signs of a majorly big struggle here, there,
everywhere. Single stab wound to the chest.

319
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:20,036
- You read my article yet ?
- Started it. So far it's really good.

320
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,704
Awesome.

321
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,630
God.

322
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,262
Cómo te dejaron a Oscarcito.

323
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,223
Te fallé.

324
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,977
Whoever did this...
he's already wishing he was dead.

325
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,196
Someone really stepped on his dick
with this one.

326
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:12,088
<i>There were so many lessons
in the vaunted code of Harry.</i>

327
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:17,385
<i>Twisted commandments handed down
from the only God I ever worshipped.</i>

328
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,887
<i>One through ten...</i>

329
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,764
<i>Don't get caught.</i>

330
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,685
<i>That I got covered.</i>

331
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,690
<i>But killing someone
without knowing if he's guilty...</i>

332
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,902
<i>I'd love some help on this one...</i>

333
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,447
<i>but my God is dead now.</i>

334
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:47,874
Man's best friend, eh, Dex ?

335
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,127
Not today.

336
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,756
Hey, my sister said that LaGuerta
knows this Miguel Prado pretty well.

337
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,967
Way back when, when Mig...

338
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,263
Hey, what's up ? Way back when,
when Miguel was in law school

339
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:06,309
and Maria was just starting
in law enforcement, they hooked up.

340
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,019
Hooked up ?

341
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:13,191
Between us, for Maria, Miguel Prado
will always be the one that got away.

342
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:25,870
Prelim has the victim,
Oscar Prado, 26, dead.

343
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,456
Dead from a single stab wound
to the chest.

344
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:32,585
The deceased's brother, ADA Miguel Prado,
informed me at the scene

345
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:37,173
that Oscar went to confront
one Fred Bowman, street name Freebo,

346
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,510
for selling drugs to some youth-club kids.
Morgan ?

347
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:45,181
Freebo's the guy that killed two co-eds
in the Everglades and got away with it.

348
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:48,351
So the way it looks,
Oscar Prado died a hero.

349
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,897
Also, our team found a shitload of, uh...
a substantial amount of drugs in the house.

350
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,440
Any leads on his whereabouts ?

351
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,528
That part of the neighborhood isn't
exactly police-friendly but I'm staying on it.

352
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:03,324
- Talk to me about forensics.
- Evidence indicates this was no hit-and-run.

353
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,913
It was a furious close-in battle. Whoever...
Or is it "whomever" ?

354
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,041
- "Whoever" is good.
- Whoever did this got in a lucky shot

355
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,502
or was really good at handling a blade.

356
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:19,715
According to the ME, the aorta
was cleanly severed in one penetration.

357
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,051
- Not easy to do.
- Any luck finding the weapon ?

358
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,970
It's not on or near the premises.

359
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,390
We've checked roofs, sewers, trash bins
in a five-block radius.

360
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,768
Our conclusion -
the assailant took it with him.

361
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,812
Dexter, what's the blood saying ?

362
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:37,108
Pretty much what everyone else is. I have
some second level on-scene work to do.

363
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,153
- I'll get back to you ASAP.
- Get it to Sergeant Batista.

364
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,321
Full disclosure.

365
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:46,701
I've had a personal relationship
with the Prado family for many years.

366
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:50,455
And it goes a lot further
than the whole cubano thing.

367
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,458
Sergeant ?

368
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:57,044
Stating the obvious, Lieutenant,
I like Freebo for this.

369
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,338
Me too.

370
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,467
Morgan ?
Yes, ma'am ?

371
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:05,928
Hit the streets harder.
Learn what you can learn.

372
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:11,434
Uh, all due respect, Lieutenant,
if Freebo did this, he's not in Miami.

373
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,768
I mean, he's in the wind.

374
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:15,271
We can sit around
on our asses and speculate

375
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,357
on where we think
the prime suspect may or may not be,

376
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,235
- or we can actually go and look for him.
- Hmm.

377
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:29,410
As a Miami prosecutor,
I have dedicated my career to fighting crime,

378
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,246
to making our streets safe for everyone.

379
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,418
Every family -
white, black, Latino, Asian -

380
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:43,966
deserves the full measure
of our devotion to their dignity.

381
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:50,890
And now that crime has touched my family
in the most profound way imaginable,

382
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,184
I grieve equally for every family

383
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,522
that has been visited
with the same unimaginable news

384
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,190
that we have received today.

385
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,818
Our beautiful city is a city of families.

386
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:09,325
And the untimely taking of any of us
touches all of us.

387
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,497
My parents brought
my brother Ramon and me...

388
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,334
<i>Part of my ritual has
always been getting to know my victims,</i>

389
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,170
<i>confirming their guilt beyond all doubt.</i>

390
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,841
<i>Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo,
then he tried to kill me.</i>

391
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:29,136
<i>No way he was there on some
noble youth-club mission.</i>

392
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:33,182
<i>He's got to be guilty of something.
Aren't we all ?</i>

393
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,560
<i>So I ask again...</i>

394
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,145
<i>Who are you ?</i>

395
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,824
<i>Two speeding tickets
and an illegal U-turn.</i>

396
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:56,706
<i>Talk about outside the code of Harry.</i>

397
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,708
<i>Harry finds me in a pool of blood,</i>

398
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,377
<i>turns me into his own
personal vendetta machine,</i>

399
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:07,300
<i>and when he sees the monster
he created in action, he kills himself.</i>

400
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,011
<i>Deb can drink to his honor
on her own.</i>

401
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,055
Any luck
in the land of reluctant witnesses ?

402
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,391
One house I play good cop,
the next I play bad cop.

403
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,977
I still can't get shit
from anybody in that neighborhood.

404
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:22,773
- You know what the problem is, right ?
- Wait, Quinn, let me guess. The "cop" part ?

405
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,235
No, they don't owe you anything.
There's no incentive.

406
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:30,781
Which skews the balance of power
way in their direction, right ?

407
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,075
Here, let me do you a favor.

408
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,912
Call this guy. Tell him you know me.

409
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,749
Tell him you want to cash in
one of my coupons.

410
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:44,003
- Coupons ?
- Yeah. He's a CI from my days in Narcotics.

411
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:48,174
He's got a hook in him
that's not coming out anytime soon.

412
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,678
- What do you want in return ?
- For you to remember that I did you a solid.

413
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,475
- What, not even a "thank you" ?
- Thank you.

414
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,603
Stop looking at my ass.

415
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,234
Yeah, of course...

416
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,036
Detective.

417
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,497
Officer. You're Anton ?

418
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,043
In the flesh.
You got something you want to show me ?

419
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,965
Oh, yeah, I've seen him before.

420
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,843
- Really ? Where ?
- In the news.

421
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,888
Isn't that that guy you let walk
on those co-ed killings ?

422
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,183
Now that there
was a fine piece of police work.

423
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,396
- You know him from the newspaper ?
- I saw him on CNN.

424
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,774
- OK. That's all you got ?
- That's all you got.

425
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:52,571
If this is you and Quinn fucking with me,
I'm really not in the mood.

426
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,281
If you need something for that temper,

427
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,702
I got a man down the street with some real
mellow weed can take that edge right off.

428
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:02,540
- I don't take advice from drug dealers, so...
- Drug dealer ? Oh, never that !

429
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,085
A drug user.
Occasionally.

430
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:11,424
- Strictly weed though, Officer. Strictly weed.
- Then how'd you become Quinn's snitch ?

431
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,302
I got caught up in a drug bust. Quinn told me
that if I blew the whistle on the bigger fish,

432
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,014
I'd stay out of jail. So I listened.
Attentively.

433
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:24,186
Yeah, well... you know,
it never hurts an occasional drug user

434
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,357
- to have more than one friend on the force.
- That's the thing, Officer...

435
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,944
- I got enough friends.
- All right, well, I'm outta here.

436
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,906
Yeah, well, you have a good one, you hear ?

437
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:44,331
What about this Prado guy ?

438
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,003
And to determine the impact site,

439
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:52,173
the exact point
where force encounters a body,

440
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,426
you have to distinguish
the geometric differences

441
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,636
between back-spatter,

442
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,263
satellite spatter,

443
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,391
- misting and arterial spurting.
- Gross !

444
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,768
Shut up.

445
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:07,146
You remember how before
when Katie's dad

446
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,607
- was talking about being a surgeon ?
- Yeah.

447
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:14,737
And sometimes how he has to
cut into bodies and there's blood ?

448
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,655
But he saves lives.

449
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:18,532
Do you save lives ?

450
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,663
OK, you know how there's good guys
and there's bad guys ?

451
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,373
So you catch bad guys ?

452
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,293
Well, not directly, but I help.

453
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,961
Do you have a uniform ?

454
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,589
Lab coat.

455
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,007
A gun ?

456
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,425
No.

457
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:41,138
- He's got a badge.
- It's a laminate.

458
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:45,768
Well, thank you so much for taking time
from your busy schedule, Mr. Morgan,

459
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:50,606
- to come and talk to the children.
- It was a real learning experience.

460
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,447
Looks like
I really got through to 'em, huh ?

461
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,159
It would have sucked even worse
if I didn't have a dad today.

462
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,580
Thanks for inviting me, buddy.

463
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:18,759
<i>If anyone should have father
issues - anger, rejection, abandonment -</i>

464
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,261
<i>it's Cody.</i>

465
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,430
<i>And what's he do ?
He moves on.</i>

466
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,394
<i>How does that happen ?</i>

467
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,112
- I was so bad you're crying ?
- No, no.

468
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,074
No, it's just...
just something I've always wanted.

469
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,451
You being here for the kids,

470
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:48,038
it's all so wonderfully uncomplicated.

471
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,047
Hello ?

472
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,426
Mr. Morgan, this is Miguel Prado.
I need to see you.

473
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,553
Right away.

474
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,145
<i>So much for uncomplicated.</i>

475
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,833
It almost feels like a piece of art.

476
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,005
Thank you, sir.
But to me it's more like a story.

477
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,635
Tell me that story, Mr. Morgan.

478
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:50,601
- The encounter started over here.
- Mmm.

479
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:55,064
The scuff marks on the linoleum,
the crumpling of the throw rug,

480
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,233
they all have a directional quality
that leads to...

481
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,446
Now this is where your brother and Freebo...

482
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,325
He's my lieutenant's prime suspect...

483
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,703
But you know that.

484
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,248
There was a brutal struggle.

485
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:18,879
I gotta say, it looks like
your brother fought like a hero...

486
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:26,136
but he was overmatched and sustained
a fatal stab wound to his chest.

487
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:33,686
Everything about the blood suggests
that your brother bled out almost instantly.

488
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:37,398
- He didn't suffer ?
- Blood never lies.

489
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,361
So now I know how he died.

490
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,990
The question is why.

491
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,201
One more thing, Mr. Morgan.

492
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:54,206
Why would a blood spatter analyst

493
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,459
spend time searching
the sheriff department's database

494
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,045
for information on my dead brother ?

495
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,090
Um...

496
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,764
Like you, sir, I wanted to understand
what happened here.

497
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:15,769
I thought that knowing some details
about your brother's life

498
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,480
would help me make sense
out of his death.

499
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:24,403
In your line of work, Mr. Morgan,
is it usual for you to get so involved ?

500
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,410
I just sounded like a prosecutor there.

501
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,162
I'm sorry.

502
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:37,082
It's not a problem, sir, and no,
it's not usual for me to get so involved,

503
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:41,128
but this one, this death, got to me.

504
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:48,802
It's just...
It seems so unreal that, uh...

505
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,598
he's gone.

506
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,142
Yeah, I know.

507
00:39:57,479 --> 00:40:04,193
So a man dies, Mr. Morgan, and what's left,
his soul ? And what is that exactly ?

508
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,029
I really couldn't tell you.

509
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,407
Cause some people say
the soul just lives on forever.

510
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,996
- I hope not.
- Which makes you a cynic.

511
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,042
It makes me a scientist.

512
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,423
So no one you've ever loved has died ?

513
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,012
My father died when I was in my 20s.

514
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,809
And you don't believe that...

515
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:41,063
that his soul,
call it his life force, is still here ?

516
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:43,398
Somehow it's living inside you ?

517
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,113
Because I...

518
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:55,577
- I should have been there for him.
- You can't blame yourself, sir.

519
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,539
That's easier said than done,
Mr. Morgan.

520
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:09,508
Do me a favor. You really want
to get to know my brother like you say,

521
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,345
come to his wake tonight.
Come see how much and how...

522
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,640
how fully he was loved.

523
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,475
OK.

524
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,855
I've taken up enough of your day.
Thank you.

525
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,066
Dexter.

526
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,536
These reports final ?

527
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,290
Blood specimens I collected all came back
belonging to Oscar Prado.

528
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,418
Trace prints on and around the victim
all point to Freebo.

529
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,961
Anyone out there talking ?

530
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:49,756
Officer Morgan was hitting up
the usual firewall of clammed-up witnesses

531
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:53,343
and non-witnesses,
so I put her in touch with an old CI of mine.

532
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,345
- Hopefully...
- Hey, Quinn.

533
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,056
That CI you put me on
was totally useless for Freebo.

534
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,893
- Sadly, it's not a perfect world.
- Yeah.

535
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,103
For all we know,
Freebo's in Nebraska by now.

536
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:07,149
- I guess you don't owe me that favor, then.
- How come he gets favors ?

537
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,736
Oh, he doesn't.
But what the CI told me about the victim...

538
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:14,114
he wasn't some hero coach who went
into the hood and took one for the team.

539
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,282
What do you mean ?

540
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:19,328
Oscar Prado was into Freebo
for some serious cash.

541
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,539
Now why would someone be
into a drug dealer for big bucks ?

542
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,957
- Shh !
- Because Oscar Prado,

543
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,419
the pride of Little Havana,
was a fucking junkie !

544
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,259
Thanks, Maria.

545
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,972
Good one, Morgan.

546
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,367
She's been in better moods.

547
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:02,412
- I didn't exactly brighten her day.
- No, you didn't.

548
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,082
Excuse me for doing my fucking job.

549
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:08,961
You see any other supercops
coming in here with any leads ?

550
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:14,716
- You're definitely amazing but you gotta...
- I know, be aware of my surroundings,

551
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,469
take the temperature of the room
before I open my mouth.

552
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,806
- It's a bad habit. I admit it.
- Well, look on the bright side.

553
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,433
Now that you've given up
men, booze and cigarettes,

554
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,478
running your mouth's
the only bad habit you have left.

555
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:30,232
That's right.
I'm a model of fucking perfection.

556
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:36,738
- You remember what today is, right ?
- How could I forget ?

557
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,366
7:30. I'll buy your first drink.

558
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,249
You wanted to see me ?

559
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,625
Siéntate.

560
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,090
I need you to think about
Debra Morgan's continued involvement

561
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,301
on the Oscar Prado case.

562
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:02,514
You want me to throw her under the bus
for being overzealous ?

563
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,853
It's not about zeal. It's about tact and
sensitivity. It's also about the real world.

564
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,273
This case is as high profile as it gets.
Óyeme, Angel.

565
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:16,778
Morgan is resourceful and tenacious and
usually the right amount of pain-in-the-ass.

566
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,114
But there are political ramifications.

567
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,619
My history with Miguel Prado aside,
this case is just too big for her.

568
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,372
Just say the word
and I will follow your orders.

569
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,126
Becoming a Homicide sergeant
is more than just a bump in pay scale.

570
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,672
It's a quantum leap in responsibility.
All part of moving up the chain.

571
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,801
If I bounce her, she'll hate me.

572
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,637
You're her boss, Angel, not her friend.

573
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,017
It's up to you.

574
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,715
He touched many people,
many hearts.

575
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,015
Qué bien que viniste.

576
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:36,066
- Can I get another cranberry juice ?
- That makes three. Problems down under ?

577
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,361
Jeez, I like the fucking taste, OK ?

578
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:47,160
Miss you, Dad.

579
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:59,381
- My condolences.
- Thank you for coming.

580
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,635
Losing my brother,

581
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,931
it's going to leave a pain in my heart
that I don't think is ever going to heal.

582
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:11,351
You have a brother, Dexter ?

583
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:24,322
No, just the one loud sister.

584
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:28,785
What she said back at the station,
it's OK.

585
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,288
I know my brother was a good man.

586
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:35,917
But I can't say that he suffered
from the tragedy of perfection.

587
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,504
Who does ?

588
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,549
Who indeed ?

589
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:45,427
Hey, brother. The mayor's here.

590
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,607
<i>You attacked me with a knife
in a dope dealer's house.</i>

591
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:03,320
<i>No, Oscar, you certainly did not suffer
from the tragedy of perfection.</i>

592
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,656
<i>Then why does this feel so wrong ?</i>

593
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:11,161
<i>Why in your death
are you still so alive in my life ?</i>

594
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,290
Did you know him well ?

595
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,335
Not as well as I thought.

596
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,795
Sorry.

597
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,963
Cuervo Black.

598
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,009
Thanks.

599
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,767
Harry.

600
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:29,072
- What the hell is that ?
- Cranberry juice. That gonna be a problem ?

601
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,865
Not even close to a problem.

602
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,243
But the taste, kind of funky.

603
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:44,212
You know, by the time my dad
was my age, he already had his shield.

604
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,465
Kinda why I'm here.

605
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,845
I'm taking you off
the Oscar Prado case.

606
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,024
I come up with grade-A intel
on Oscar Prado,

607
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,193
and I'm getting tossed off the case
for being a little loud ?

608
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,778
In a nutshell.

609
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,825
- LaGuerta put you up to this ?
- It was my decision.

610
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:25,045
I'll tell you one thing, Angel...

611
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,342
I'm not letting anyone
get in the way of me getting my shield.

612
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,345
There's only one person in this department
who can get in your way.

613
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:34,596
Who ?

614
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,556
You.

615
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,778
Can I get a real fucking drink, please ?

616
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:01,581
<i>My sister still lives her life
trying to please our father.</i>

617
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,127
<i>Me...</i>

618
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,383
<i>I'm following the lead
of an eight-year-old kid.</i>

619
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,053
<i>I'm moving on.</i>

620
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,063
Thank you for last night.

621
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,816
It was a nice surprise.

622
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:32,612
This is where I wanted to be.

623
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,749
Again ?

624
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:50,964
All I want is chocolate pudding... and you.

625
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,509
Not necessarily in that order.

626
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,476
Morgan.

627
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,986
- Where the fuck were you last night ?
- Rita's.

628
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,447
- It wasn't Rita's night.
- Turns out it was.

629
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,490
- I called you.
- I know.

630
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,744
- And you ignored me ?
- Not you. Harry.

631
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,120
Deb...

632
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:27,250
I'm in a whole 'nother place when it comes
to Dad. I'm working out some personal stuff.

633
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,878
You are such a fucking guy.

634
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:34,841
What is this, you gotta kill your father so you
can become your own man kind of bullshit ?

635
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,302
Dad wasn't perfect...

636
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,554
but he was there for you.

637
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,766
- Deb, wait.
- What ?

638
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,895
I'm sorry I didn't notice your haircut.

639
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:54,194
So what is it ? Is it too short,
too young, too dorky, what ?

640
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,279
It's beautiful.

641
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,739
Beautiful ?

642
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,876
You just said "beautiful".

643
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:13,171
Yeah, I did, cause it is.

644
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:19,594
Looks like you honored Dad
for both of us last night anyway.

645
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,263
I had some help.

646
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,644
You getting along
with the new boss man ?

647
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:31,481
Oh, fuck him. He took me off
the Oscar Prado case and put me on this.

648
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,733
Some dead-end Jane Doe.

649
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,073
A couple of ladies of the night
called this in...

650
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,783
Oh, Madre de Dios.

651
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,285
Could you turn that thing off ?!

652
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,955
We'll work quietly.

653
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:52,585
About halfway through your article, Vince.
So far, very moving.

654
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,256
Yeah, I was trying to make
second-tier chromosomal analysis sexy.

655
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:58,341
Glad you're picking up on it.

656
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,760
- Strangled.
- No blood. I'm the blood guy.

657
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,179
- Why call me in ?
- Because of this.

658
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:12,313
- Looks like our evildoer had an agenda.
- Maybe it was a tattoo or something.

659
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,817
Dex, I need to know
if this was ante or postmortem.

660
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,364
<i>Teegan.</i>

661
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,032
<i>Freebo's girlfriend.</i>

662
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,869
<i>Looks like he's still in Miami.</i>

663
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:34,544
Oye.

664
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,214
- You talk to Morgan yet ?
- Yep.

665
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,383
How'd she take it ?

666
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,888
- There were curse words involved.
- You did good.

667
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,765
Sergeant.

668
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:04,574
Way to be.

669
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,371
Thank you.

670
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:49,744
There you go, Dexter.
Good as new.

671
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,839
Hold the elevator. Hold...

672
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,929
Asshole.

673
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,391
Sorry. Sergeant Asshole.

674
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,521
Vamos, Masuka, Quinn.

675
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,023
iVamos !
We got some celebrating to do.

676
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:25,363
- You can still drink after last night ?
- A man has his needs.

677
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,532
You can go back to your
cute little cranberry juice.

678
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:32,787
Nah, it tastes like shit. I'm gonna
have a mojito or ten on you, Sarge.

679
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,093
Morgan.

680
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,721
You so have the wrong person.

681
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,057
Oh, there's a good reason
why Quinn's of interest to IA.

682
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,770
No, understand me. When I say
you have the wrong person, I mean me.

683
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,524
These people are more than badge
numbers to me. They're my friends.

684
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,652
- They're my family.
- Shh ! Listen.

685
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:09,782
That's the sound of your shield
calling for help.

686
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:21,961
<i>Harry said that what was inside me
would be there forever.</i>

687
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,589
<i>And that I wouldn't be able to change.</i>

688
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,675
<i>He was half right.</i>

689
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:31,429
<i>Killing Oscar Prado
was a bell I can't un-ring.</i>

690
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:36,642
<i>I have moved on from my father, but
I still need his code, now more than ever.</i>

691
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,687
<i>But it has to evolve,
become my own.</i>

692
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,357
<i>Change is good.</i>

693
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,610
Hey, you.

694
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,111
Hey, yourself.

695
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,743
This music again ?

696
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:55,661
Chocolate pudding again ?

697
00:56:57,998 --> 00:56:59,999
- Oh, shit.
- What ?

698
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,043
I've done this before.

699
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,545
- What do you mean ?
- I'm pregnant.
