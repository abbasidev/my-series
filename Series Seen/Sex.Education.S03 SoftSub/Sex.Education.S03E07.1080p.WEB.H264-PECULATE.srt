1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,520
<i>After eating her mother,</i>

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,400
<i>Glenoxi found herself
exiled from Oblivion 6</i>

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,840
<i>and left to wander the desolate crevices</i>

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,960
<i>of the planet Zorg on her own.</i>

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,800
<i>With no food and no water...</i>

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,360
<i>...Glenoxi was feeling
her lifeblood drain away.</i>

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,120
<i>She made her peace with dying like this.</i>

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,240
<i>As a creature
that never felt she belonged,</i>

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,240
<i>facing the end on her own
seemed only fitting.</i>

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,360
<i>But then Glenoxi saw Starlanza
for the first time.</i>

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,120
<i>As the water hit her lips,
Glenoxi knew that this was her soulmate.</i>

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,280
<i>The only creature in the whole universe</i>

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,240
<i>who would understand
and accept her completely.</i>

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,120
<i>And she was overwhelmed
that Starlanza felt the same.</i>

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,560
Lily Pad,

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
you should get ready for school.

17
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm not going.

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
Still feel sick.

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, it's been three days.

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,200
Ola's called on the house phone again.

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,360
Have you two had a fight?

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,160
No, we're fine.

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,680
Well,

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,160
I've got to go to work now.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,360
Hopefully, you'll feel better tomorrow.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,160
<i>193.</i>

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,640
194, 195,

28
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,960
196,

29
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,600
197, 198,

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,960
199, 200.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,200
Yeah!

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,920
Can you change this bulb for me?

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Sure.

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
Thank you.

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Ah.

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
There you go.

37
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,440
Bit sweaty.

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Sorry.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,440
I'll jump in the shower.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,320
<i>Thanks for that report
from our traffic correspondent.</i>

41
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
<i>And all eyes
are on Moordale Secondary today</i>

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,200
<i>as they hold their first open day</i>

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,680
<i>since the "Sex School" controversy
of last term.</i>

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,040
<i>Hope Haddon has said she aims
to clean up Moordale's dirty name...</i>

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Yeah?

46
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,640
Gotta get my jacket.

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,080
We have our session
with Dr. Cutton later today.

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I'll think about it.

49
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,760
Good luck with your TV interview.

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,520
Oh f...

51
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Hey.

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Hey.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm worried about Lily.

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,040
She hasn't spoken to me
since everything that happened with Hope.

55
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,480
- Could you go talk to her, please?
- I'm not a therapist, Ola.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,240
I know, but she told me about how much
you helped her with the vaginismus stuff.

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,840
I think she really trusts you.

58
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm not the right person to ask. Sorry.

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,320
Could you please do up my buckle, Otis?

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Really?

61
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,800
I thought we'd grown out
of the silent treatment phase.

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Look,

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,560
I know that you're both aware
that Jakob and I are having some issues,

64
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,760
but I want you to still feel
that this is your family home

65
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,640
and a safe space
for you to talk about your feelings.

66
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
Why is my dad
not part of this conversation?

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,080
Your dad feels it's better not to talk
about these things with you guys.

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,320
So you can't even agree on
how to tell us you might be splitting up?

69
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,280
Lots of couples have differing opinions
on how to parent children.

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,960
Maybe you should have thought about that
before you decided to have a baby

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,920
and make us
all pretend to be a bizarre family!

72
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,080
I'm going to school!

73
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,240
It's all a bit of a mess.

75
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,480
Everything you do
seems to turn into a mess, Mum.

76
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,400
Through! And over! Over!

77
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,200
Up! Yes! Well done! Yes!

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,840
Yeah! Good girl. Oh!

79
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,320
Didn't know she could do that.

80
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,760
Don't forget, it's your uncle Peter's
dinner party this evening.

81
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,760
Oh, no. I'm not going.
Uncle Peter's a dick.

82
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,640
- Adam!
- I'm just saying.

83
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,920
You're not with Dad anymore.
I don't know why you're going.

84
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,520
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

85
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,800
Peter is a bit of a dick.

86
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,840
But I'm just trying
to ease the adjustment process.

87
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,560
- Is your friend Eric back?
- Yep. Okay.

88
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

89
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Hey.

90
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Hey!

91
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,600
- How are you?
- Yeah, good.

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Yeah?

93
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,920
Ooh! My mum.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mm-hmm.

95
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
Okay, let's go.

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
Hello, Maureen.

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Okay.

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
I missed you.

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,440
- I missed you too.
- Yeah?

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,680
Yeah.

101
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Come.

102
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Let's go.

103
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Hello?

104
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
<i>Yeah. Hey.</i>

105
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,440
- Mum?
<i>- Um...</i>

106
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Where are you?

107
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,080
Mum, you need to bring Elsie ba...

108
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,520
Have they found Elsie yet?

109
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
No.

110
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
I think I know where my mum is though.

111
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,200
So you haven't been replying to my texts.

112
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,240
Yeah, well,
I am quite annoyed at you right now.

113
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,040
Fair enough. I would be too.

114
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,360
Listen, we don't have to talk about this
when you've got stuff to worry about.

115
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Okay, fine.

116
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,600
But I just want you to know
that I'm confused about all of this.

117
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,600
What am I supposed to say to that, Maeve?

118
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,001
If you're not sure you wanna be with me,
then it's probably not right.

119
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,600
- Isaac.
- Look.

120
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,440
I need to be with someone
who's sure about me

121
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,480
because I think I deserve that.

122
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,520
And even if you and I
were able to work this out,

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,960
I would still be worried
that you'd regret not trying with Otis,

124
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,360
and I can't do that.

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,240
So with respect,

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm taking my heart off the table.

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,320
Good luck finding your mum.

128
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,080
- You both still wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

129
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,600
- Yep.
- Yes!

130
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Incoming.

131
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,960
Happy Open Day!

132
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,720
Are you prepped?

133
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,080
I'm really looking forward to it.

134
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
That's good.

135
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,080
- Eric! You're back! Yes!
- Hey!

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,760
I missed you!
How was Nigeria? Tell me everything!

137
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Oh, it was good. The wedding was great,
and my family was the best!

138
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,720
What are you doing?

139
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,920
I've run out of clean pants,
and I'm chafing real bad.

140
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,360
- What is that?
- It's my shame sign.

141
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,280
I threw a poo
out the coach window in France.

142
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,880
Except it wasn't me. It was Rahim.

143
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,960
We're kinda friends now.

144
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,400
- You're friends with Rahim?
- Kind of.

145
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,280
Whoa, whoa, wow. Wow! Wow!

146
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,720
What? It's itchy.
You know how big my balls are.

147
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Okay, fine. But we are in public.

148
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Go to the bathroom and sort yourself out.

149
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
- Fine.
- Fine.

150
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,440
You need to tell him about the thing.

151
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
What thing?

152
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,280
- Hey! Sorry. Hi. Have you seen Aimee?
- Oh!

153
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,120
- Hi. No. Maeve?
- Okay. Yeah?

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
I was gonna text you to apologize,
but that felt pathetic. Can we maybe talk?

155
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,520
I don't really have time right now.
I think I found my mum, so...

156
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,120
- Do you need any help?
- It's okay. I'll let you know how it goes.

157
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,000
What are we apologizing for?

158
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay, okay.

159
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,080
So, in France,

160
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,080
and please don't freak out, but...

161
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,680
Maeve and I kissed.

162
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
You okay?

163
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm actually speechless.

164
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,480
What kind of kiss?
A peck-on-the-cheek kiss or a kiss-kiss?

165
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,600
Um, it was a kiss-kiss.

166
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,480
What happened after this kiss-kiss?
Are you guys a couple now?

167
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,280
No. I messed it all up again.

168
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,320
She thinks I don't care about anything
now I don't do the clinic.

169
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,240
You think that's true?

170
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
You don't do the clinic anymore

171
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,920
because you had your heart broken,
and you couldn't be around Maeve.

172
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,560
I don't think you stopped caring.
I think you had to protect yourself.

173
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,720
Please, tell me this was at least
the best kiss of your entire life!

174
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,160
- It was pretty amazing.
- Aha! I'm so proud of you!

175
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,920
Otis! Can you help me out
with something for the thing?

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
Our computer guy has dropped out,
so we need a replacement.

177
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,480
I thought of you 'cause you seem nerdy.

178
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,720
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,640
- So, yeah.
- Okay.

180
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,200
Well, I was kinda hoping
to stay out of this one.

181
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,920
Um, what?
Of course you'll help. I'll help too.

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,120
Thank you.
Hey, be more Eric, okay? Thank you.

183
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
I agree with that, actually.

184
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,240
What's the thing?

185
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,760
- Thought you were shutting down the stall.
- It's for the thing!

186
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
They look great.

187
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,680
- Aimee, have you got a sec?
- Thought we weren't talking.

188
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,240
I've been an absolute arse.

189
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,520
Me too. Steve, hold the cakes.

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,560
I'm so sorry. You're right.

191
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm shit at asking for help,
and I push people away.

192
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,720
No. I should never have done
what I did without asking first.

193
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,960
I didn't realize how hurtful it would be.

194
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,616
Thing is, I need help now,
and you're the only person I can trust.

195
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,320
Okay. What we doing?

196
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
Can you drive me to Lockwood-on-Sea?

197
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Right. Steve, you're in charge
of vulvas from now on.

198
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,000
If anyone asks, the wobbly bits
aren't mistakes because...

199
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,920
All vulvas are unique.

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Good lad.

201
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,120
They better not be squished.

202
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,520
He does these silly air punches
like he's Bruce Lee or something.

203
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,480
He bites his fork when he eats.

204
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
It's only been a few months.

205
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,640
I shouldn't be
so irritated by him, should I?

206
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
Are there any positives?

207
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,160
We have lots of sex.

208
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Ooh.

209
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Well, a healthy sex life is important
for many people.

210
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
I know it won't last though.

211
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,120
There was a time that Michael and I
couldn't keep our hands off each other.

212
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
And then

213
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,200
it just stopped.

214
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,480
Well, that doesn't have to be inevitable.

215
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,040
Oh, I've been meaning to tell you
that Michael stopped by the other day.

216
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,720
He was returning something that
belonged to me. We ended up having a chat.

217
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,640
About what?

218
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,360
I think he's struggling a bit
and just needed someone to talk to.

219
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,760
That's a bit rich.

220
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,920
Sorry.

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,600
It's just... Why wouldn't he talk
to me all those years?

222
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,680
And Adam's exactly the same.

223
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,600
It's just so lonely sometimes
with all these men.

224
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,880
Well, Adam will talk to you
when he's ready.

225
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,200
You know, I'm not very good
at letting Otis come to me.

226
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,200
I admire your restraint.

227
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,320
- Twenty minutes.
- Thank you.

228
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,920
Oh, that looks nice.

229
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,840
We are making way for a brighter,

230
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,880
cleaner future

231
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,200
here at Sparkside Academy.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,640
You can fucking do this.

233
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
The press are arriving.

234
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,880
It's Superman pose.

235
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,120
It helps with nerves.
There's a TED Talk on it.

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Right.

237
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,480
Making way for a brighter,

238
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,680
cleaner future

239
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,960
at Sparkside fucking Academy.

240
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Fuck.

241
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Yes.

242
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
- Why are you wearing that?
- You told me to.

243
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,440
Okay, take it off now.

244
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
Yeah.

245
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,640
- Hope! It's a good turnout.
- Yes!

246
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
Lots of prospective students,
the press, and all our private investors,

247
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,280
so, uh, no pressure at all.

248
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,440
Right. Well, I'll be interested
to hear your feedback.

249
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,160
Would you, um, just excuse me a second?

250
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,280
Mm. Yeah.

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Cal?

252
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,160
Come with me.

253
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,320
Get your hands off me!

254
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
You have been told repeatedly
to change your behavior,

255
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,720
but you are clearly innately disobedient.

256
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,920
The press would be interested
to hear about

257
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,120
the way I've been discriminated against

258
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,720
due to how I present.

259
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm left with no choice but to keep you
in here for the remainder of Open Day.

260
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,400
You're in violation of my rights.

261
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Let me go!

262
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,520
Well, this... this is different.

263
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
Oh.

264
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,960
So, yeah,
all pretty self-explanatory.

265
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,920
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,480
- Stop.
- Okay.

267
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,200
- Start.
- Okay.

268
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
- Dimmer.
- Mm-hmm.

269
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,840
- And do not press these red...
- This one?

270
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,600
- Yeah. Don't press that.
- Okay.

271
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
- I'll keep him...
- Okay.

272
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,760
I mean, I was imagining something
more center stage, but this is cool.

274
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,760
It's likewe're in <i>Ocean's Eleven,</i> innit?

275
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,000
Maybe I'm George Clooney,
and you're Brad Pitt?

276
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,776
- No.
- I'm Brad Pitt. You're George Clooney.

277
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,920
- I'm Andy García. If I'm anyone.
- Who's Andy García?

278
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,920
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
while you boys hash that out.

279
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,960
- Yeah.
- I'll see you both on the other side.

280
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,520
- Thank you! Don't do that.
- Yeah! Yeah.

281
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,840
I think that
Jackson is Rihanna in <i>Ocean's Eight</i>

282
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,320
- Because of the bone structure and eyes.
- I've not seen it.

283
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,240
- No?
- No.

284
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
- Okay.
- But fine.

285
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,400
It was very good.

286
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,200
- Ugh, this fucking fringe.
- Aimee, can you please look at the road?

287
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,600
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

288
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,440
Right, come on. You and Otis kissed
in France. What happened?

289
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,320
I don't know.

290
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,320
My head's all over the place
at the moment.

291
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,880
- Things are over with Isaac as well.
- Hmm.

292
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
I feel bad about hurting his feelings.

293
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,280
I'm sorry, babes.

294
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,560
Does this mean you and Otis
might actually finally get together?

295
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
I don't know.

296
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,281
We've changed a lot,
so I don't know if it would work out.

297
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,040
I think you should just
bloody go for it, love.

298
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,440
It's like Simone de Beauvoir says,

299
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
"From the hour you're born,
you begin to die."

300
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,040
I think it means "live for the day."

301
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Yeah. Once I realized
she wasn't a lad called Simon,

302
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,280
her writing started
to make a lot more sense.

303
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,240
I shouldn't have said
that stuff about you and Steve.

304
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,520
I didn't mean it.
I think you're great together.

305
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,560
No, you were right. It's not working out.

306
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,760
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,040
- Can you please look at the road?
- Sorry.

308
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,960
- I love you, love.
- I love you, love.

309
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,360
- My concentration's not great.
- It's all right.

310
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,200
I'm sure some of you probably had
your reservations about coming here today.

311
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,040
I don't think anybody wants
to send their child to a school

312
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,160
that's famous for STIs and sex musicals.

313
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,480
But I'm here to assure prospective parents

314
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,680
that these scandals are
a thing of the past.

315
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,480
And so it is my promise to you

316
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,040
that if you should choose
Sparkside Academy for your child,

317
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,120
that they will receive their education
on a safe

318
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,920
<i>and sex-free campus...</i>

319
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
Sex-free camp... People fuck in the bushes!

320
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,800
We will protect our youth at all costs.

321
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,640
Now, let's hear it from a shining example
of Sparkside's new ethos,

322
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,440
Vivienne Odusanya.

323
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,080
- Here we go.
- Whoo!

324
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Come on, Viv!

325
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,040
Thank you, Hope, for giving me
the opportunity to speak today.

326
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,800
Firstly, I'd like to invite
Jackson Marchetti onstage

327
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,880
to reclaim his position as head boy.

328
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,120
Whoo!

329
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,400
Thank you, Viv.

330
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Ah.

331
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,600
It's good to be back.

332
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,840
We agree with Hope
that students should feel protected

333
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,280
whilst on campus.

334
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,880
The students of Moordale Secondary
would like to share some ideas

335
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,680
<i>on how we think</i>

336
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,600
listening to young people

337
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,480
could make our new campus
the safest place to study in the UK.

338
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
We hope you enjoy.

339
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,840
What the hell is going on?

340
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,000
- It's a very slow screen.
- It is a slow screen.

341
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,040
And here we go.

342
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,200
<i>Hi! We're the students of Sex School.</i>

343
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
<i>You might recognize us from the press.</i>

344
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,560
<i>We're the deviant youths
having loads of S-E-X.</i>

345
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,520
<i>And catching chlamydia.</i>

346
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
<i>And writing musicals about dicks!</i>

347
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,976
<i>But I'm not embarrassed
to be a student of Sex School.</i>

348
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
<i>Sex, well, it's part of being human.</i>

349
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,680
<i>Whoa!</i>

350
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,480
How did you let this happen?

351
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,280
- I'm going to stop the video.
- Do it quickly. Don't make a scene.

352
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
<i>...bodies and identities.</i>

353
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,000
<i>Which is why
schools need safe spaces</i>

354
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,840
<i>for people to ask those things
that some might find a little awkward,</i>

355
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,240
<i>where there's no shame, stigma, or fear.</i>

356
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,360
<i>Because when shame
is used as a weapon,</i>

357
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,680
<i>it doesn't just hurt people.</i>

358
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,400
<i>It can damage them forever.</i>

359
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,400
<i>But the opposite of shame is pride.</i>

360
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,040
<i>And the students of Sex School are proud
of the things people like to shame us for.</i>

361
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,240
<i>Because if Lily Iglehart
is a weirdo</i>

362
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,960
<i>for writing short stories
about aliens with penis hands,</i>

363
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
<i>we're definitely weirdos too.</i>

364
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,560
<i>I love my clitoris,
and I feel no shame.</i>

365
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
<i>Ladies, get your wank on!</i>

366
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,360
<i>I bind my chest, and I feel no shame!</i>

367
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,320
<i>I have a hairy bum, and I feel no shame.</i>

368
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
<i>I am literally perfect...</i>

369
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,240
Stop the video now!

370
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,600
<i>I'm great at anal douching,
and I feel no shame.</i>

371
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,720
<i>- I'm great...</i>
- That's not gonna do anything.

372
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,920
There's nothing to see here.

373
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,760
- Get out of my way!
- Eric!

374
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,080
<i>I'm great at anal douching.
I'm great at anal douching.</i>

375
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,720
<i>I'm great at anal douching.</i>

376
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Drop the plug.

377
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,800
- What?
- Ruby?

378
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,320
I said, drop it! Ah!

379
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,280
- Ruby. Miss!
- Miss!

380
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,680
- Oh my... Is that?
- That's a burn.

381
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,240
Ow! What are you doing?

382
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
Yes, yes.

383
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,680
Oh my God! Wow!

384
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,800
Ruby!

385
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,080
<i>I'm great at anal douching,
and I feel no shame.</i>

386
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Right.

387
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
Ru... Ruby!

388
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,680
You cannot do that!
You mustn't do that!

389
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,840
- Ow!
- Oh God! Jeez!

390
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,440
<i>I'm great at anal douching...</i>

391
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,280
That is very expensive perfume.

392
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,520
- You're incredible!
- I know.

393
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,440
<i>I'm attracted to boys and girls,
and I'm trying not to feel shame.</i>

394
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,440
What have you done?

395
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,320
<i>I have a third nipple,
and I have no shame.</i>

396
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,120
Now, was that Fleurs du Mal?

397
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,720
- Come on! Come on!
- What the fuck?

398
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
Oh, this school...

399
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,640
<i>A lot of shame comes from
old-fashioned views on sex.</i>

400
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,840
<i>Sadly, schools have taught a lot of people</i>

401
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,640
<i>to feel ashamed
of their identities and bodies.</i>

402
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,360
<i>The cycle continues today.</i>

403
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,920
<i>But the world is changing,
and young people have had enough.</i>

404
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,520
<i>So if you agree that communication
and empathy are better tools</i>

405
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,240
<i>than silence and shame,</i>

406
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,160
<i>then join us
by asking your school for better.</i>

407
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,760
We are Sex School!

408
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,880
We are Sex School! We are Sex School!

409
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,520

412
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,040

413
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,520
We are Sex School! We are Sex School!

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,960
Thank you! Thank you all for listening.

417
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,600
And now the choir will sing us out

Come on, Moordale!

463
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,040
What's wrong
with schools teaching abstinence?

464
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,480
Well, schools that teach abstinence

465
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,080
actually have a higher rate
of teen pregnancies and STIs

466
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,960
than schools
with comprehensive SRE programs.

467
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,560
And when we give teens

468
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,680
<i>agency, information, and trust,</i>

469
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,560
<i>there's a much higher success rate...</i>

470
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
<i>Sorry, Dr. Milburn, apologies.</i>

471
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,800
<i>It appears there's a situation developing
as we speak at Moordale Secondary.</i>

472
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,520
Let's go live there now
to our reporter on the ground.

473
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,440
<i>What was meant to be the day</i>

474
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,000
<i>that Moordale Secondary squashed
the title of "Sex School"</i>

475
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,880
has evolved
into something quite the opposite.

476
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
<i>Students have taken to protest,</i>

477
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,160
<i>doubling down
on their belief in sex positivity,</i>

478
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,600
<i>and saying that
new head teacher Hope Haddon</i>

479
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,640
<i>is quite simply behind the times.</i>

480
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
<i>But as you can see...</i>

481
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,040
Otis?

482
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,520
<i>- ...from the "Wall of Vulva" behind me...</i>
- Oh.

483
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,640
<i>- ...the question remains...</i>
- Ooh.Ow.

484
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,320
<i>...how progressive is too progressive?</i>

485
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,880
These people will know. I can sense it.

486
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,840
Okay.

487
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,720
Hi! Have you seen a woman
with blonde hair and green eyes?

488
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,600
Kinda looks like her, only older.

489
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,480
- Oh. Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

490
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,240
Maybe this was a stupid idea.

491
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,160
She used to bring us here
as kids all the time,

492
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,280
usually when she was feeling guilty
about something.

493
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,640
At least you've tried.

494
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,960
Hi, Mum. Hi, Elsie!

495
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,360
- What you doing here?
- Should ask you the same.

496
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,880
- Mummy's taking me on a boat.
- Fuck!

497
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,120
Come on!

498
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,520
- This is amazing.
- Mm.

499
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,240
You know this started with you, right?

500
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,760
- What do you mean?
- You and Maeve.

501
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,776
The clinic thing. Getting everyone
to talk about their problems.

502
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,120
If it wasn't for that, I don't think
vaginas would be getting drawn on a wall.

503
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Vulvas.

504
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,360
You like helping people.

505
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,520
It's one of the reasons
I love you so much.

506
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,080
I know you've been hurt, but I don't think
you should lose this part of yourself.

507
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,920
It's a very good part.

508
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,600
- Thanks, man.
- Mm-hmm.

509
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
- I've gotta go, actually.
- Where?

510
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh my God! That clitoris is gorgeous!

511
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,680
- Shall we get out of here?
- Yeah.

512
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,880

<i>Michaela!
I've invited Maureen for tonight.</i>

524
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,640
<i>Hope that's all right.
You're not technically divorced, right?</i>

525
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,000
No. No, that's fine.

526
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Is the new boyfriend coming?

527
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,960
<i>Ha! Hope not.
That would be really awkward for you. Ha!</i>

528
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,080
<i>- Anyway, gotta go. See you later, bye!</i>
- Bye.

529

<i>♪ Clap your hands now

530
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,936
- I can't believe we did that!
- Yeah.

531
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,360
- I am so proud of you.
- Oh, I'm proud of you too.

532
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,200
- Come on. I'm feeling a bit left out here.
- What?

533
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,480
Oh, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

534
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,720
- Yeah, see you later.
- See you, Viv.

535
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,080
Hey.

536
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,320
So, you wanna hang out?

537
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
Yeah.

538
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,160
Okey dokey, let's be having you.
All aboard the Skylark!

539
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,400
I'm not due for eight weeks.

540
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,880
That's it, darling.

541
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,320
You're the lady
who used to do therapy at the school?

542
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah, that's me.

543
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,320
My daughter's at Moordale.
She's going through a bit of a tough time.

544
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,240
Quite worried about her, to be honest.

545
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,680
I wish she had someone professional,
like you, she could talk to on campus.

546
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,360
Sorry. That's the last thing
you want to be thinking about.

547
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,896
Oh, no, it's good to be thinking
about something else.

548
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,720
Why's she having a tough time?

549
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,120
Keep breathing.
Um, well, she's refusing to go to school.

550
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,760
She's always been a bit of an outsider.

551
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,040
She's obsessed with aliens
and things like that.

552
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,880
I don't think people really get her.

553
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,400
I don't think I understand her sometimes.

554
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,600
Well, I'm sure
you're more alike than you think.

555
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,360
Maybe try and find some common ground,
something you can relate to in her world,

556
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,320
and see if the conversation starts there.

557
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,640
Ooh, oh shit!

558
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,080
Okay, blow out the candles
with me, darling.

559
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,440
I'll try Jakob again.

560
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
It's funny.

561
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,120
She's the one that wanted this meeting,
but she's the one that's late.

562
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,080
You mean, you wouldn't choose
to be here if it weren't for Jean?

563
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,680
No.

564
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,600
Well,

565
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,840
perhaps we can use this time to talk
specifically about your feelings, Jakob.

566
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
I feel fine.

567
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,560
You don't seem fine. You seem angry.

568
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Well, she's late.

569
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Can I ask you
about your previous marriage?

570
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,640
She... she passed away.

571
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,200
Yes, but I wonder,

572
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,960
can you tell me a little bit
about the relationship before she died?

573
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,360
We met young.

574
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,000
I loved her very much.

575
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,320
And I think she loved me.

576
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,280
But it was young love.

577
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,960
Um, we were both very naive. And...

578
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,480
then things changed
once we had our children.

579
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,840
How did it change?

580
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,120
She met someone else.

581
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,960
I think she...

582
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,960
she wanted to leave me.

583
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,520
Then she got sick.

584
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,600
It was all very confusing.

585
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,040
Yes, I can imagine it must have been.

586
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,120
But you stayed with her.

587
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,080
Yeah. You don't leave
when someone is sick.

588
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,440
And we made it work...

589
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,760
...until the end.

590
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,760
When did you grieve?

591
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,920
When she died,

592
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,680
I...

593
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,720
broke down into pieces.

594
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,560
Yes, but when did you grieve
for what you lost

595
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,200
when your wife had the affair?

596
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,640
It must be very hard
to trust anyone properly again.

597
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,480
Especially when you weren't able
to fully process the feelings that you had

598
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,040
about your wife's betrayal.

599
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah, I have a problem with trust.

600
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,760
But I want to try.

601
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Mm-mm.

602
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Too fast?

603
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,920
- Yeah, I'd rather keep it off.
- That's cool.

604
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,960
I mean on.

605
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,440
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

606
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,600
You really are so beautiful.

607
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,360
Oh shit, that's a gendered word.

608
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,680
Pretend I didn't say that.

609
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,080
I'd also still be into you
if you weren't beautiful...

610
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,856
Not that I don't find you beautiful.
I do think men can be beautiful.

611
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,480
- Like a beautiful soul. Know what I mean?
- Jackson.

612
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,400
Don't worry about it.

613
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,280
- Okay.
- Mm.

614
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,240
I really didn't mean what I said.

615
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,400
I'm sorry.

616
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,000
No, it's... it's fine. It's okay.

617
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Okay.

618
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
I just feel like I fucked up.

619
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,800
Should we just stop?

620
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:20,400
Um, yeah. I mean, you seem tense,
and now I'm tense too.

621
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Yeah.

622
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,080
- We can try again another time.
- Yeah.

623
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
Yeah.

624
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,520
If this was going to become more serious,

625
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,720
then you would be in a queer relationship.

626
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,160
Is that okay with you?

627
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Yeah.

628
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,520
Yeah, I haven't, like,
got a problem with that...

629
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,640
Hm.

630
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
...at all.

631
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,480
Um...

632
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,120
- I have to go.
- What?

633
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,160
Just... I just gotta help my mum out
with some stuff.

634
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,400
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

635
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Okay.

636
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,560
But I'm... Yeah, okay.

637
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

638
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,200
What the fuck?

639
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Ugh!

640
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,640
You don't wanna do this, Mum.
That's why you called me.

641
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,520
Don't tell me what I wanna do.

642
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Who is that girl who keeps staring at us?
She's freaking me out.

643
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,000
It's my best friend, Aimee.
She gave me a ride here.

644
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,320
- And what? Is she undercover, is she?
- No.

645
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,440
Thanks very much.

646
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,680
How am I supposed to know?
You're good at calling the police on me.

647
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,040
- You have any idea how that fucked me up?
- You've been fucked up about it?

648
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,120
- Try having your kid taken off you!
- Mum, I'm 17!

649
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,640
- I should never have had to report you!
- I know I wasn't there for you, okay?

650
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,080
But it's different with Elsie.
I'm gonna give her a better life.

651
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,920
Mum, you can't stay clean.

652
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,080
It doesn't make you a bad person.

653
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,416
It's just Elsie needs someone
in her life who isn't using.

654
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
What, like Anna?

655
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,360
Can we go and see Anna?

656
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,960
Come on, Els, let's go.

657
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,960
Did you get onto that thing
for smart kids in America?

658
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,520
- How'd you know about that?
- That boy Isaac told me about it.

659
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Yeah, I did, but I can't afford it.

660
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,640
Mummy, I want to see Anna.

661
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
Do you think Anna loves her?

662
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Yeah, I do.

663
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,760
Hey. You're gonna stay with Maeve.

664
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,680
- I wanna stay with you, Mummy.
- It's not very nice where I'm going.

665
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,240
It rains all the time,
and there's no chips!

666
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,440
I love you.

667
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
Oh, I love you too, darling.

668
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,120
You go back to Anna's
with Maeve, and I'll visit.

669
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,480
- Okay?
- Okay.

670
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,600
Oh, I'm a lucky mummy.
Bye-bye, darling. Bye-bye.

671
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,600
Please just take her
before I change my mind.

672
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,320
Elsie, come here. Come give me a hug.

673
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,000
Bye, Mummy.

674
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,720
Hey, Lily. It's Otis.

675
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Can I come in?

676
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
We missed you today.

677
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,240
And the school realized
what Hope did to you guys was wrong.

678
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,120
We all got together to fight
for what we wanted Moordale to be like.

679
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,160
It was kind of amazing.

680
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,560
It also made me kind of sad

681
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,880
'cause, uh...

682
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,720
I've realized
I've shut myself off recently.

683
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,600
I stopped believing
it was my place to try and help anyone.

684
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,960
I got hurt last term.

685
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
Badly.

686
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,920
And I didn't wanna do the clinic anymore.

687
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,680
But that doesn't mean

688
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,560
I shouldn't try and be a good friend.

689
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
I saw you

690
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,000
after Hope humiliated you.

691
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,600
I didn't even ask if you were all right.

692
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,480
I should've checked in.

693
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm...

694
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,280
I'm really sorry I didn't.

695
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,320
Ooh!

696
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,680
Why are you on the floor?

697
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,800
Do you want some alien stuff?
I'm throwing it away.

698
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I'm okay.

699
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
Thanks.

700
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,320
Ola said you guys aren't speaking.

701
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,240
We're kind of fighting.

702
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,960
I think she's going through
a tough time too.

703
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,360
She's really missing her mum.

704
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,560
Maybe I've been a bit distracted,
but I'm not ready to talk to her yet.

705
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,680
I didn't think we were friends.

706
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,160
Well, I... I know we don't hang out much,

707
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,480
but I think we like each other.

708
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,320
Meh, you're all right.

709
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,760
I know what you mean about shutting off.

710
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,440
I do that, too,

711
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,320
when I'm hurt
or I feel like I don't fit in.

712
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,640
What do you do when you shut off?

713
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,880
Hm.

714
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,320
Think about my stories.

715
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,720
About alien planets and galaxies.

716
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,960
I used to do it all the time
when I was a kid, but...

717
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,000
I guess it's just weird
now that I'm getting older.

718
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,240
It's really common

719
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,920
for people to create
rich fantasy worlds to escape into.

720
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's what most artists do.

721
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,080
They are brave enough
to show the weirdest,

722
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
most vulnerable sides
of themselves in their work.

723
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,480
Which helps a lot of people
not feel as alone.

724
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Thanks, Otis.

725
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,360
But I don't think I'm an artist.

726
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,080
I wouldn't be so sure.

727
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,680
And even if you do decide
to not write about aliens anymore,

728
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,320
you shouldn't ever give someone
the power to humiliate you.

729
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,400
You're great.

730
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,400
Just the way you are.

731
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,800

739
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,600
I don't know if she's gonna be ready
for the competition.

740
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,600
- It's probably dumb.
- Adam!

741
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,720
It's so great you've entered at all.
Your mum will be so proud.

742
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,680
Hm. Well, I've not invited my mum.

743
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,440
So you only invited me?

744
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,840
Yeah. You're the only one I want there.

745
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,480
I've been thinking

746
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,160
that maybe we could try
going out together.

747
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,400
Maybe somewhere a bit more gay?

748
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,280
Like a... like a gay bar?

749
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,920
Yeah.

750
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,800
Or like, um, a club or something.

751
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,920
Mm.

752
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,440
We could get dressed up. Could be fun.

753
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,720
Mm. Uh...

754
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,080
I don't think that would be my thing.

755
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,720
- You like it when I put makeup on you.
- Yeah, when we're in my room.

756
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,120
I don't know if I'm ready to do that with...

757
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,360
in front of people.

758
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,200
I like it when it's just you and me.

759
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,640
I have to tell you something.

760
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,240
I kissed someone else.

761
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
In Nigeria.

762
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,880
You what?

763
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,280
It just happened. I'm so sorry, Adam.

764
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,320
I need to go and feed Madam, so...

765
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,880
Madam?

766
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,680
Amazing!

767
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,600
You're nearly there, Jean.

768
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,880
Where the fuck is Jakob?

769
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,600
Keep breathing, Jean.
You're doing amazingly.

770
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,840
Amazing!

771
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,440
That's it. That's it.

772
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,616
Brilliant.

773
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,120
Why are there so many people?

774
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,280
When babies are a little early,
they always like to have us all here.

775
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,600
I said,
"I'm injured in three places,"

776
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,800
and the doctor says,
"Well, don't go there."

777
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,240
Ah, bummer!

778
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,040
- Maureen says she can't make it.
- Aw.

779
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,000
This salad's delicious.
Did you make it, Peter?

780
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,560
No, I don't have the time,
unfortunately, to cook.

781
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,920
That's why God gave us caterers!

782
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,720
Very good.

783
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,000
I made that one, actually.

784
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,720
Oh. Where'd you get the recipe?

785
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,200
- I saw it on a television program.
- Mm.

786
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,080
But I added the feta and the parsley.

787
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,280
I love a man who can cook.

788
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,840
I don't think making a salad
is exactly cooking, is it?

789
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,240
Putting a lot of leaves in a bowl.

790
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:31,080
But wait till you taste the chocolate
and beetroot cake for dessert.

791
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,920
It's to fucking die for and gluten-free.

792
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,720
- Guilt-free. Huh?
- Mm. There is something sweet in there.

793
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,840
I put honey in the dressing,
and there's also pomegranate seeds and...

794
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,960
Pomegran...

795
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,560
Could somebody here give
my little brother a job?

796
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,280
He's got too much time on his hands.

797
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,040
What you doing?

798
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
I'm leaving.

799
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,360
Why? The grown-ups
are in the middle of dinner.

800
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,080
Because I can't bear to waste
another precious second of my life

801
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,280
pretending to like you.

802
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,000
You're awful.

803
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,680
Oh, that's a wee bit dramatic,
don't you think, Michaela?

804
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,840
My name is Michael!

805
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,440
And my life is a failure.

806
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,640
My wife's left, I'm quite sure
my son hates me, and I'm unemployed.

807
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,560
But I'd rather all those things than be
a pumped-up shit of a man like you.

808
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,800
You've been a shit since you were a child.
I think you'll be a shit until you die.

809
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,320
Probably because our dad
was the biggest shit of all.

810
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,440
And you learned to bully me
so he wouldn't bully you.

811
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,960
And that is such a great shame.

812
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,040
But I am too old
for it to be my problem anymore.

813
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,240
Goodbye, Peter.

814
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,040
He, uh... He's...

815
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,880
I like this bowl.

816
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,800
Hi. I got your messages. Where is she?

817
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,920
She's in there.

818
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,640
That's it, darling.

819
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,840
I need you to give me
one last big push, Jean.

820
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,680
Come on. Come on. Come on.

821
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,440
That's it. You've done it!

822
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,560
It's a little girl!

823
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,080
I'm so sorry I was late.

824
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,600
It's a girl.

825
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,800
You did it! You did it!

826
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,280
She's so tiny.

827
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,600
So tiny.

828
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,600
You did so good.

829
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,440
- I feel strange.
- What?

830
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,240
Something's wrong.

831
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,920
What? Something's wrong.

832
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,440
What's happening here? What's happening?

833
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,040
Can you please step outside?

834
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,720
Thank you so much, Maeve.

835
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
Come here.

836
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,040
Will you stay again tonight?

837
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,600
You've had a really shitty day.

838
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Yeah, that would be nice.
I'm just gonna say goodbye to my friend.

839
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,200
Okay.

840
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,800
Maeve, I know
you don't like emotional shit,

841
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,280
but I've been thinking about
how you don't really have a proper mum,

842
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,480
and I wanted you to know
that even though my mum has money,

843
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,160
she's also crap sometimes too.

844
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,760
So I was thinking
that maybe we could be each other's mums.

845
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,440
Thanks, Mum.

846
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,080
You're welcome, Mum.

847
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,480
- Hi, Maureen.
- Hi.

848
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,080
I made a salad.
I thought you and Adam might like it.

849
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,800
Actually, that's not true.
I just wanted to see you.

850
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,760
And I just wanted to say

851
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,760
that I know I was hard to live with,

852
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,800
that I'm rigid, and I'm uptight.

853
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,560
I don't know how to be spontaneous
or anything close to happy.

854
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,680
But I do want to change.

855
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,480
I want to try to be the man that you want.

856
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,240
Do you think we could talk?

857
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,600

Hi. Oh, it's me again.

869
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,080
Is Maeve here?

870
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,160
Yeah. Yeah, she's in the back garden.

871
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,280
Hey.

872
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,120
Hi! What are you doing here?

873
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,640
I, uh, I needed to talk to you.

874
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,360
What's... what's going on?

875
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,400
It was never about the clinic.

876
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,960
I did the clinic to be close to you.

877
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,640
And then you made me realize
I'm good at something,

878
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,640
and I like helping people.

879
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,240
And I thought you ignored my message,
and it crushed my heart.

880
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,760
I stopped doing the clinic
because it reminded me of you. It sucked.

881
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,760
'Cause I wanna help people.

882
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,240
I know this is only about money for you,
but let's just be a team again, please?

883
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,400
If I can't be with you romantically,
I still wanna see you every day.

884
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,680
Nothing feels right
when you're not around.

885
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,520
It wasn't just about the money for me.

886
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,240
I wanted to be close to you too.
