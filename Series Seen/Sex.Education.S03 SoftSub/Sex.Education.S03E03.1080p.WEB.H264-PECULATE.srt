1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,840
That was delicious, Cynthia.

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,800
Why don't we, uh, skip pudding, eh?

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,560
Oh yeah, baby!

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,040
Oh! So good!

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,400
Yeah!

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,360
That's it, baby!

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,200
Oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh yes!

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,800
Oh! Yes!

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,480
Oh, Jeffrey!

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,040
Ooh! That's your monkey, Jeffrey!

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,840
Yes, it is!

12
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,720
Oh yes!

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,360
Oh!

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,080
Jonathan!

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,880
He might be all right.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,680
Oh!

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
Vile.

18
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Bam! Bam!

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,760
Hi! Uh, Ola, is this my Titanic record?

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,760
Yeah, it's great!

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,640
Yeah. Well, the thing is,
some of my records are quite rare.

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,720
- I like to keep them in their place.
- Dad, where's my biology book?

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,216
How would I know?

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,536
What were you saying?

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Well, I was wondering
whether maybe you could ask

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,760
before taking my stuff.

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,480
Where's my toothbrush?

28
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,080
In your washbag!
Yeah, yeah. I'll ask you next time.

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,336
Okay, this is scratched!
This is scratched!

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,400
- No!
- Ola, this is a limited edition!

31
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,360
Oh my gosh! Calm down!

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
Fuck me!

33
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm dropping Goat off
at my auntie's after this.

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,760
It's not a problem, Aimee.

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,360
And I want you to know
that this is a safe space

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
for you to share,

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,880
and we can go as slowly as you want us to.

38
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
I told you. In your washbag!

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,800
Will you excuse me just one minute?

40
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Um...

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
It's okay.

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,120
It comes with a sleeve.
A cover and a sleeve. There it is!

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
- Give it to me. Fuck!
- I'm doing it.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,640
You don't take care of anything!

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,120
There's dust. You don't have
a case for the record player.

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,296
Ola!
Why do you need five shampoos?

47
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,136
- It's in here!
- What's the big deal?

48
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,360
You took my property without asking!

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,320
- You're so anally retentive!
- And you don't understand boundaries!

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,136
- She's taken the Titanic without asking!
- He's being over the top...

51
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,680
And I'm sure you can both work it out

52
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,240
like the responsible young adults
that you apparently are!

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,240
Quietly!

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
Get out!

55
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,240
Jakob, I have a client downstairs!

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Found it.

57
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,720
Can everyone please keep it quiet
while I'm working?

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,360
It's too loud!

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,720
Ooh, ooh.

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,680
Um, my vagina doesn't look like this.

61
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,240
One of my lip bits
is longer than the other.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,360
Well, it's just an educational model.

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,840
The external part is called the vulva,

64
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,120
and the lip bits you're talking about
are called the labia,

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,120
and they come in all different shapes,
sizes, and colors.

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,360
There's a fascinating website
I could direct you to

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,280
that highlights the wide variety
of different vulvas if you're interested?

68
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
- Yeah.
- Great.

69
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,280
Do you want to have a seat again?

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,440
Let's try that again.

71
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,880
Do you feel comfortable telling me
a little bit about why you're here?

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,600
Last term, I was sexually assaulted.

73
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,880
And I thought that I was getting over it,

74
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,280
but I don't think I am.

75
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,200
I used to like my body,
and I used to like having sex,

76
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,720
but ever since it happened,
I don't like the way my body feels.

77
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,680
I don't like looking at it.

78
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,520
I don't like
my boyfriend touching it anymore.

79
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,520
That must be difficult for you, Aimee.

80
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,520
Do you think you could tell me
a little bit more about the assault?

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,560
I was going to school,

82
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,160
and everything felt normal.

83
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,720
And then

84
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,600
I got on the bus...

85
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,680
and there was this

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
man.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,080
Sorry, I just find it hard
to talk about it sometimes.

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,160
It's okay. We don't have to talk
about anything you don't want to.

89
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
I just wanna be the old me again.

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Well, you may never be the old you, Aimee,

91
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
but that's okay.

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,840
As human beings,
we are constantly changing and developing.

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,480
And by processing this trauma,

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,080
you may gain clarity on the event itself,

95
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
and we can move you towards

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,920
healing the relationship
with your body again.

97
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,680
Would you like that?

98
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Yeah, I'd like that.

99
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,640
Fuck.

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,720
Sorry.

101
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
- Why doesn't she ring the doorbell?
- Why don't you mind your own business?

102
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,520
- Otis, what's wrong with your tie?
- What is wrong with it?

103
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,760
Let me help you.

104
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Hey.

105
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,800
- Good morning.
- Morning.

106
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,920
Otis, do you think
Ruby could give Ola a ride to school too?

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm not cool enough to be hanging around
with the Untouchable King and Queen.

108
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,640
Well, I hope that's not true, Otis.

109
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm meeting Lily anyway.

110
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,640
I was thinking
we could all hang out later, together?

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,000
- I've got a date. I can't.
- I'm busy too.

112
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,840
I just want them to get along.

113
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I know. They will, eventually.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Smoothie?

115
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Yeah?

116
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

117
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,320
Yes, Jeffrey, yes!

118
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,960
Harder, harder!

119
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
- Just went to get some milk.
- Didn't ask.

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,840
Yes, Jeffrey, you sex god!

121
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,400
There are many ways
that I would describe Jeffrey,

122
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,760
but "sex god" is not one of them.

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,600
- Jeffrey.
- I'm going to school.

124
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,440
Come back to bed, lover.

125
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,600
I can't have sex again.

126
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,920
You have no idea
how annoying Otis is.

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,640
It's like he's never shared a space
with anyone before.

128
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,520
And they do things so differently there.
Everything. Everything is so controlled.

129
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
This is it!

130
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,640
Where'd it go?

131
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,800
It... it was here, I swear.

132
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,800
Maybe someone did it as a hoax.

133
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,480
Good morning, Hope.

134
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,776
I've had ideas about how I can use my time
as head girl in the most productive way.

135
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,680
- Cool, hit me.
- Great.

136
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,920
I wanna create
a Moordale newsletter run by students.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,400
I've been researching
how we can make the campus more green

138
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,360
by using solar panels and tree planting.

139
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,720
I wanna set up
an environmental student board on campus.

140
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,080
I read a study that said yoga
during break time creates more efficiency,

141
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
so free yoga classes
alongside food-education classes.

142
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,400
- And I think...
- That is fantastic.

143
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,960
I want to set up a meeting
to talk it through properly.

144
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,880
In the meantime, I need you to make sure

145
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,280
all your peers are wearing
their uniforms correctly.

146
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,600
Absolutely, will do.

147
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,840
Okay. Any problems, you send them to me.

148
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

149
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Hey, Jackson.

150
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,440
Whoa, whoa! Fuck.

151
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,840
Falling at my feet now?

152
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,600
Man, you look kind of screwed, dude.

153
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Yeah, um...

154
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,480
Everything got
really fuzzy for a second.

155
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,960
Did you forget to eat breakfast?

156
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,720
Breakfast is my favorite food.

157
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,800
Okay, but is breakfast a food or a meal?

158
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
Thanks.

159
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,481
Every time I see you,
I feel like I've known you for ages.

160
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,360
I think that's the dizzy spell talking.

161
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,600
Come on, up you get.

162
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,080
Hi! Sorry. You're in the wrong uniform.

163
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,320
What is wrong about it?

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,920
It's the boys' uniform.
It's way too big for you.

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,800
- I think it's a comfortable fit.
- I'm following new guidelines.

166
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,120
- You can let this one slide.
- Sorry, I can't.

167
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,760
- You'll have to talk to Hope about it.
- Oh! Well, that'll be fun.

168
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
Why did you do that?

169
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,800
I'm not gonna disobey rules
because you have a crush.

170
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
I don't have a crush.
That's not the point.

171
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,960
Unlike you,
I'm taking head girl seriously.

172
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,640
You can be so cutthroat sometimes, Viv.

173
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,960
I do not do fake wool.

174
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
This blazer is itchy as fuck.

175
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,360
At least we look better in them
than everyone else.

176
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,160
- Yeah.
- She didn't mean you.

177
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,360
- Hi, Ruby.
- Hey.

178
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,360
Gray is not my color.

179
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,200
Come on. It's not that bad.

180
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,480
I kinda like it.

181
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
OT!

182
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,520
- Um, yeah.
- See you.

183
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,600
Okay, um, I'm going to need you
to make an effort tonight.

184
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,800
- Okay.
- I need you to talk, open up a bit.

185
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,040
Okay, I understand.

186
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Cool.

187
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Hi, Rahim.

188
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,400
I would like my books back.

189
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,240
Pablo Neruda, Maya Angelou.

190
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,840
Sure, I'll bring them in for you.

191
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,360
I'd also like you to return
the poems I wrote for you,

192
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,200
that is, if you haven't destroyed them.

193
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,120
I still have the poems, yes.

194
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,360
I burnt everything you ever gave me
in a small, controlled fire, so...

195
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,360
Okay, I will get you your poems.

196
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,240
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

197
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,880
- You have confiture on your tie.
- Hm?

198
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,760
Hi. How was therapy?

199
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,840
Oh, it was amazing!

200
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,960
Do you know most women's vulvas
don't look like they do on PornHub?

201
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,520
I thought mine was a bit ugly
because it's not all tucked in,

202
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
but it's dead normal.

203
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,280
You should read <i>Come As You Are</i>
by Emily Nagoski. It's a great book.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,080
- I'll lend it to you.
- Okay.

205
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
You look nice, babe.

206
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,160
Is everything okay? I feel like
we barely see each other at the moment.

207
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,000
Aw, everything's fine.
Just really busy with my baking.

208
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
Good morning, Moordale.

209
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,120
Don't you all look smart?

210
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,240
I know this probably feels
like a big change,

211
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,560
but you'll find that having a uniform
creates a sense of unity

212
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,880
and equilibrium.

213
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,760
And speaking of changes,

214
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,680
the choir will now sing
the new school anthem,

215
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,400
"Non Sibi, sed Toti."

216
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,840
Shh.

217
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,160
Why are they singing in elf language?

218
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,520
I think it's Latin.

219
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
- Well, what does it mean?
- "Not for oneself, but for all."

220
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,120
- Do you wanna hang out later?
- Yeah. I've got...

221
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,440
I need to see you both
in my office, please.

222
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,640
- Oh, Maeve?
- Yeah?

223
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Come with me.

224
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
Come on in.

225
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,560
Please, sit down.

226
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,960
Iced VoVos, anyone?

227
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,720
My husband made them.

228
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,640
They're biscuits. They won't bite.

229
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,440
- They've told me to come talk to you.
- Yes. Come on in. Shut the door, please.

230
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,280
I know breaking old habits is hard work,

231
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,080
but I want you all following uniform rules
by the end of the week.

232
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,640
Cal, you can go and put these on.

233
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm not wearing a skirt.

234
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Fine.

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,880
You don't want to wear a skirt,
that's up to you. I'm a feminist.

236
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,880
I understand.
But you will wear a uniform that fits you.

237
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,400
No baggy trousers
hanging around your ankles.

238
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,960
- I actually...
- I think I'm being more than fair.

239
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,000
Lily,

240
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,560
your hair and makeup is fun,

241
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,440
but it's not appropriate for school.

242
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,480
Maeve, this isn't a campus
for Cookie Monsters.

243
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,240
- Are you referring to my hair?
- I am.

244
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,560
Ola, only school badges allowed,
I'm afraid.

245
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,840
It's my LGBTQIA+ badge.
It's important to me.

246
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,000
Of course it is, but I hope
that your values aren't so fragile

247
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,680
that a little badge
is all that supports them.

248
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,280
Remove it.

249
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,640
Lily, am I right in thinking
that you wrote the musical last term?

250
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,360
What did your parents think of it?

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,280
They didn't really get it.

252
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Hm.

253
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,640
Well, enjoy the VoVos.

254
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,360
Back to class.

255
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Oh, Maeve?

256
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,880
Miss Sands tells me
you're interested in applying

257
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,360
for the Gifted & Talented program
in the States.

258
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,280
Uh, no, I can't afford it.

259
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,240
I want opportunities in this school to be
for everyone, no matter their background,

260
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,920
so I'm going to see what I can do
about getting some funding,

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
so you better get that application in
as soon as you can.

262
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Okay.

263
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I will.

264
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
- Thank you.
- Yep.

265
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,520
And I mean it about the hair.

266
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,560
Thank you. Hope will see you now.

Maeve's changed the locks.

280
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,280
Yeah, I can see that.

281
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,560
The thing is,
I think I left my passport in there

282
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,960
and it needs renewing.

283
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,760
- Have you got a spare key?
- No, sorry, I don't.

284
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,640
Why don't you come wait inside
until Maeve gets back?

285
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,040
I can offer you a tea,
but you'll have to make it yourself.

286
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,080
- My brother's out.
- It looks just like her, don't it?

287
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,840
How have you done that?

288
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,240
- You never.
- Mm.

289
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,280
Well, you're very talented.

290
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,880
You've even captured her angry eyebrows.

291
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,360
She feels awful.

292
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,760
Talks about it all the time.

293
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,400
She was just worried about Elsie...

294
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,720
Well, it's not really
any of your business, is it?

295
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Sorry.

296
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,520
Would you like me to paint your portrait?

297
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,000
- I couldn't afford anything like that.
- It's fine.

298
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,000
I like to practice,
and I think you got a great face.

299
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,880
I did once get asked to be a hair model.

300
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,120
Just some academy wanting
to experiment on people, but still,

301
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,040
nice to be asked.

302
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,960
Okay, then.

303
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,240
Where'd you want me?

304
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,560
Just in the corner where the light's good,
actually, would be great.

305
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm not stripping off!

306
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Maeve?

307
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Did you, uh, did you call me earlier?

308
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Hm?

309
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,160
Oh yeah, I did! But it was an accident.

310
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Oh, okay.

311
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,680
- What do you think of the whole...
- Actually, Otis, I need to talk to you...

312
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,480
What are you doing here, cock biter?

313
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,720
Don't call her that, please.

314
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,960
Your girlfriend's charming.

315
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
- What did you wanna talk about?
- Don't worry about it.

316
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,880
- So 6:30 tonight, yeah?
- Yeah.

317
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,400
Well, I was thinking
I could meet you at yours at six,

318
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,680
walk in together?

319
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,640
No, it's fine.
I'll just meet you at the restaurant.

320
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,440
Okay, bye.

321
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,880
But you're still
taking me home now, right?

322
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,720
- Wanna do homework later?
- Not really.

323
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,840
- Why you being so weird?
- Oh, um, because you stole my job, Viv.

324
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,160
I don't understand why you're pretending
you cared about being head boy

325
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,280
when you didn't.

326
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
This is an amazing opportunity for me.

327
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,240
Well, I hope it's worth it.

328
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Yo!

329
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,360
- Hey. No more dizzy spells, then?
- No.

330
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
You wanna hang out with me?

331
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Yeah.

332
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,360
Your mum doesn't half tell some stories,
doesn't she?

333
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,920
Have you heard the one about
the one-night stand with Steve Guttenberg?

334
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I used to have
a St. Bernard called Kevin.

335
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
He did shits the size of a yule log,
but, God, I loved him.

336
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,360
Oh, Kevin.
The only decent man I've ever known.

337
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,400
What's going on?

338
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,200
Isaac, tell Maeve I need to get
my passport from the caravan,

339
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,080
and tell her I'm having my picture done
because you said I had a nice face.

340
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,240
I think she heard you.

341
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,480
We'll be a bit longer, I think,
while the light's good.

342
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,160
Why don't you come
get your passport once you're done?

343
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,040
Isaac, tell Maeve I'll come get
my passport once I'm done here.

344
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,200
- Have you got that?
- Yeah.

Thought you were gonna wear
something smart.

365
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,600
What? My mum washed my jumper.

366
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,960
Remember to ask questions tonight.

367
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,720
You're not scared of heights, are you?

368
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Nah.

369
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,160
- How long are you gonna be?
- I'll just be a minute!

370
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
Oh shit!

371
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,400
Excuse me, Jean. I was wondering
whether you had any tampons?

372
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,640
Sorry to be awkward.
I just got my period, and I've run out.

373
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,960
No, it's not awkward at all.
I think I've got some up in my bedroom.

374
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,040
- Your dad has very good taste.
- Those were my mum's, actually.

375
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,440
She loved everything with peonies.

376
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,880
This must be

377
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,840
an especially hard transition
for you, Ola,

378
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,720
and I want you to know that
you can talk to me about it at any time.

379
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Okay.

380
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,200
Did you get pregnant on purpose
to trap my dad?

381
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,480
No!

382
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,600
Of course not.

383
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,360
You really hurt him last time.
He didn't get out of bed for weeks.

384
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,600
He's been through so much.
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

385
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,080
- I really care for your dad.
- Then why did you hurt him before?

386
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,880
Ola, have you used my razor?

387
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,200
- It's blunt and covered in hair.
- Yeah. I couldn't find mine, sorry.

388
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,600
Great.
Guess I have to start labeling my shit.

389
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,640
- Otis, that's very ungenerous of you.
- We're not real siblings, Mum.

390
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,240
It's okay. He's going to have
a real half-sibling soon.

391
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,360
So maybe he'll be less
of an arsehole to them.

392
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,720
Yeah, <i>maybe.</i> I've gotta go.

393
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,640
Tampons?

394
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,480
Yes, right.

395
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Tampons.

396
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,040
- What's with your...
- ...accent?

397
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,920
My family moved here
from Minneapolis two years ago.

398
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,560
- Cool.
- Do you want some?

399
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,560
Nah, I shouldn't.

400
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,640
Thanks though.

401
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
Are you religious or something?

402
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,600
No, um,

403
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,840
I used to swim.

404
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,720
I couldn't do that kind of stuff,
so I haven't tried it.

405
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
That's okay. You do you.

406
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,920
All right, let me try some.

407
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,760
Hm.

408
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,440
- Oh, you good?
- I'm good.

409
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,240
Why did you go all woozy today?

410
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,880
It's anxiety.

411
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,200
I've always had it,
but it's been pretty bad recently.

412
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,120
Mm-hmm.

413
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,800
I think now I'm not swimming,
I haven't got a routine.

414
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,040
I get triggered by the most random stuff.

415
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,440
It's okay.
I have anxiety, too, so I get it.

416
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,840
- What was the trigger this time?
- Just school.

417
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,200
I was thinking if I don't swim anymore
and I'm not head boy,

418
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,200
and I'm not very good at acting,

419
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,360
then who the hell am I?

420
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,600
Like, maybe I don't care
about anything enough.

421
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,960
Whoa. You're 17.
You don't have to have it figured out.

422
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,080
This is not the message
the world is giving me.

423
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,400
Maybe try
just being Jackson Marchetti for a bit?

424
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,400
All right, I'll try.

425
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,240
What's Minneapolis like?

426
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,640
Whoa, that feels really weird

427
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,440
coming out of my mouth.

428
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
Minneapolis-ah.

429
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,880
Pa-la-pa-la-pa.

430
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,160
- Why does that feel so weird?
- I think you're just getting really high.

431
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,600
- Oh, is it?
- It is, yeah.

432
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Pa-la, pa-la!

433
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,400
We getting high in Minneapolis, baby!

434
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,280
Whoo!

435
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,600
Ruby, you have slayed your look!

436
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,600
It smells like canned soup in here.

437
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Hi.

438
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,320
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good look.

439
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,840
- Hi.
- All right?

440
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,360
There's nothing gluten-free.

441
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,360
How long have you been diabetic?

442
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,120
I'm not diabetic.

443
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,320
You can't eat sugar.

444
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,400
Gluten, Adam. Not glucose.

445
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,200
Does anyone else...

446
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,920
like the smell of their own farts?

447
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,960
You told me to ask questions.

448
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,240
A bit nervous. It's hot.

449
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,080
Take your fucking jacket off, then!

450
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,440
Quickly.

451
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Hey!

452
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Hi.

453
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,880
Jean was unpacking my mum's stuff today.

454
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,920
Felt strange.

455
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,840
I miss her so much.

456
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,080
Circletruther3250 thinks it's possible
aliens made the crop circle disappear.

457
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,680
I thought I was imagining it,
but I think the 8th is still gonna happen.

458
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,920
What's the 8th?

459
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,680
All these stars are gonna align,

460
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,440
which will allow one alien mothership
to make it to Earth.

461
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,080
It's gonna change everything.

462
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,320
Okay, cool.

463
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,520
- Guess what?
- What?

464
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm ready for you to read my story.
I'll send it to you now.

465
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,120
Okay.

466
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,960
Well, fucking hell!

467
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Oh!

468
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,880
Hello.

469
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,440
Definitely a geranium.

470
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Mmm.

471
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,760
Fucking hell!

472
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,920
So, are you guys excited
about going to France?

473
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,040
Not really, I get coach-sick.

474
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,040
Aw. I wish I could go.
Got to go to a wedding in Nigeria.

475
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,720
Isn't it illegal to be gay in Nigeria?

476
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,080
Yeah, it is,
but no one knows I am there, so...

477
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,680
I didn't know it was illegal.

478
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,760
- Yeah, it's no big deal.
- It sounds like a big deal.

479
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,640
Can we talk about it later?

480
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,400
Adam, how is your dad?

481
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,480
Uh, I don't know.
I haven't seen him for a while.

482
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,840
My parents are separated.

483
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Yeah. Yeah, I heard, sorry.

484
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,640
Well, my mum's having a baby
with Ola's dad, which is kind of weird

485
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,840
because we used to date,
and now we're like actual siblings.

486
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,800
Maybe don't tell people that.

487
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,040
Pretty weird, dude.

488
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,680
How do you feel about it?
New family, baby, and stuff?

489
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,640
It's a big adjustment

490
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
'cause I'm an only child,
but I'm trying to be more adult.

491
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,280
Yeah, I think Ola's finding it hard too.

492
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,240
After her mum died
and her sister's gone off to university,

493
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,520
it's just been her and her dad, so...

494
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,200
...maybe you can
help each other out.

495
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
- Did I say the wrong thing?
- No.

496
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,080
That was very astute, actually.

497
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,960
- Holy shit!
- What?

498
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Kim Kardashian's having
another surrogate baby.

499
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,520
She is so bold. I can't believe it.

500
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,240
Don't you think it's weird how

501
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,600
the last surrogate was never in the show?

502
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,480
I watch the Kardashians

503
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
with my mum.

504
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,800

00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,760
Yes, yes. Come on!

517
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,800
- I've done it!
- Come on!

518
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,120
Yes, come on!

519
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,840
So ultimate question,
Khloe, pre or post <i>Revenge Body?</i>

520
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,760
Pre.

521
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,040
I totally agree
because she's more relatable.

522
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,400
- Big-time.
- Yeah.

523
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,200
I think I'm starting to get
the whole Adam thing.

524
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah? He grows on you, doesn't he?

525
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,040
Hello, hello, hello, hi!

526
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,600
That was fun.
Are you guys going back to Ruby's now?

527
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,920
I've never actually been to Ruby's house.

528
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,760
Really? But you guys have been
seeing each other for a while.

529
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,280
Anyway, this was nice.

530
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,840
Adam, text me once you've watched
the <i>Kylie Does New York</i> spin-off, yeah?

531
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,960
- Buh-bye.
- Oh! Oh, uh, bye.

532
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,360
Okay.

533
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,160
I think we were walking
in the same direction, but...

534
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Yeah.

535
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Ooh!

536
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,440
Oh, do you wanna feel the baby kick?

537
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,640
- Really?
- Yeah, right there.

538
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Oh.

539
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,520
Oh.

540
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,880
It's stopped. It was so strong though.

541
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,840
Oh.

542
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,480
Maybe it's gone back to sleep.

543
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,960
What do you think about Thor?

544
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,160
As what?

545
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,920
A name, if it's a boy.

546
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,560
Why do you laugh?

547
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I don't know.

548
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,440
- Thor?
- Yeah.

549
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,800
- Thor?
- Thor.

550
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,280
That's the name of the superhero
with the pumped-up muscles.

551
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
A bit silly, isn't it?

552
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,400
It was my father's name.

553
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
It's a very common name in Sweden.

554
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,200
No big deal.

555
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
I'm sorry.

556
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Yes, I can think about

557
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,440
Thor, sure.

558
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,760
Thor Nyman.

559
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
That's a strong boy's name, huh?

560
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,760
Why does a boy's name need to be strong?

561
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,400
Well, you said yourself,
the kick was strong.

562
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,280
Yes, but the baby can be any sex
and have a strong kick.

563
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,320
And why do you just assume
the baby's going to have your surname?

564
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,040
It ain't gonna be Milburn
'cause that's your ex-husband's name.

565
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,720
No, but it could be my maiden name,
which is Franklin.

566
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,600
You gonna change your name
back to Franklin?

567
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,400
I don't know!

568
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,960
Probably not,
but I haven't thought about it yet.

569
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,920
Well, then it makes more sense
if the baby's a Nyman.

570
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,240
It's easier
to stick to traditions, I think.

571
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,960
I'm actually surprised
that you think like this, Jakob.

572
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,760
It's so old-fashioned.

573
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,520
I mean, next you'll be telling me
that you vote Conservative.

574
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,840
I don't vote.

575
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,440
What do you mean, you don't vote?

576
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,600
- Never have.
- You don't vote?

577
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,680
I think
this would look good in our bedroom.

578
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,360
I think
that would look good back in the box.

579
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,880
You're funny.

580
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,000
I'll be okay from here,

581
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
so...

582
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
How come
you never invite me to your house?

583
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,640
I don't "never invite" you...

584
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,440
My house is shit, okay?

585
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,920
People assume I live in a big,
fancy house, but I don't, okay?

586
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,800
So I don't invite people over.

587
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
Ever?

588
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,720
Not even Olivia and Anwar?

589
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,800
Well, I'd like to see it.

590
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,040
But I understand
if you don't wanna show me.

591
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,960
Oh, fine!

592
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,280
Would you like to see my house?

593
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,200
Why, yes, I would.

594
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,200
So annoying sometimes, Otis.

595
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,560
I don't think
you should go to Nigeria.

596
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
Why?

597
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
It's dangerous to be gay there.

598
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,520
It's dangerous to be gay anywhere.

599
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,520
It's a part of me. I wanna go.

600
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,080
It's not as dangerous here.

601
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,960
Adam, stop it, man. You don't understand.

602
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,840
Did Rahim understand?

603
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,240
Why would you say that?

604
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,160
I don't know.

605
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,040
Why did you keep all of his stuff?

606

608
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,960
Mum.

609
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,080
Mum!

610
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,640
Adam, you're home!

611
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,840
Hi, Eric!

612
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,960
Hi.

613
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,000
- It's lovely to see you again.
- You as well.

614
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,760
Oh, sorry. Um, this is Hugh. He's...

615
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,440
Well, he... he's my...

616
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,200
the guy that I'm dating at the moment.

617
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,920
- How you doing?
- That's Adam.

618
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,240
And this is Eric, Adam's...

619
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Uh...

620
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,080
friend.

621
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Hi.

622
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,360
Hi. Lovely to meet you.

623
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,080
Do you boys want something to eat?

624
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,720
Uh, no.
We're gonna go play some video games.

625
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,160
Uh, actually, I'm going home.

626
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,160
Lovely to see you again, Maureen.
Lovely to meet you, Hugh.

627
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,560
Bye, mate.

628
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Yeah.

629
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Oh.

630
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,280
Well, it's nice.

631
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,400
It's not, but thank you.

632
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,640
Dad?

633
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm... I'm stuck!

634
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
Dad?

635
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,720
- What are you doing?
- I dropped my biscuit!

636
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,360
- My balance is fucked, Rubes!
- Can I help?

637
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,720
You know it is.

638
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
- Sorry. Oh Jesus.
- Oh!

639
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,200
Sorry, mate.

640
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,480
Ah!

641
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,640
Where's Mum?

642
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,600
Can't waste a Hobnob.

643
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,840
Oh, your mum got called in
for a cover shift at the hospital.

644
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,720
Why didn't you call me?
I could've come back.

645
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,560
I didn't wanna ruin your date.

646
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,440
Speaking of, do I finally get to meet
the famous Otis?

647
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,040
Otis, my dad, Roland. Dad, Otis.

648
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Hello!

649
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,080
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

650
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,040
Okay, you've met now,
so thanks for helping. Off you go.

651
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,800
Go? But he just got here.

652
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,760
Otis, stay for a bit.

653
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,920
Let's... let's hang.

654
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,680
No, Dad!

655
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,320
Please don't say hang.

656
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,320
Don't worry. I'll put on my dressing gown.

657
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,120
- How about that?
- That sounds great.

658
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,240
That'll be my weed dealer.

659
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Did the uniform really not fit,
or do you just not wanna wear it?

660
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,320
Shit, sorry. Was that rude of me?

661
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,840
No, it's fine. Uh...

662
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,760
Wasn't the right fit for me.

663
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,400
I don't like clothes clinging to my body,
but I don't really have a choice.

664
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,080
A lot of people don't really get it.

665
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,000
Who doesn't get it?

666
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,160
The whole world, Jackson.

667
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,200
I used to get changed
in the abandoned toilet block

668
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,920
so the idiot popular girls
wouldn't say shit about my body.

669
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,720
Other queer kids would change there too.

670
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,560
It was more comfortable,

671
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,000
but it's gone now, so...

672
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,720
That's so messed up.

673
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,600
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to talk to Hope about it?

674
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,840
Thanks, but I can fight my own battles.

675
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,920
- You're not head boy anymore, remember?
- Oh shit. Yeah, I forgot.

676
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,680
This is the first time
I've felt calm in so long.

677
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,520
Yeah. It's quite nice, right?

678
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,680
Going on holiday, Mum?

679
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,680
No! I need it
for my appeal to get Elsie back,

680
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,960
which I wouldn't have to do
if it wasn't for you!

681
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,800
For God's sake. Mum, please.

682
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,200
Okay, I know I've hurt you.
I was just doing what I thought was right.

683
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,600
I didn't want Elsie to get hurt
like Sean and I did

684
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,960
'cause you have an illness.

685
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,880
- What?
- You do! I'm sorry!

686
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,320
I know it's not your fault,
and I know you're trying,

687
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,920
but you haven't beaten it yet.

688
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,080
You might not for a really long time.

689
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,280
That doesn't mean I won't always love you.

690
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,160
'Cause I'll always love you, Mum.

691
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,560
Even if you hate me.

692
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,840
Tell Isaac I'll be back
in a couple of days for my painting.

693
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,480
My fingers aren't nimble anymore.

694
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,360
Why don't you stick around for a smoke?

695
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,240
Sure. Need a break
from the old ball-and-chain.

696
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,560
Dad started smoking last year
because it helps with the pain,

697
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,880
but we couldn't get it on prescription,
which is bullshit.

698
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,600
<i>♪ When I grow tired of you... ♪</i>

699
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,600
Do you want a puff, Rubes?

700
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,080
No, Dad. Who's gonna help you
when you fall out of bed again?

701
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,120
- Otis?
- I'm fine, thank you.

702
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
You are such an irresponsible parent!

703
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,880
Young people.

704
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,520
They're so clean-cut these days.

705
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,920
Ah, yes.
Thank you, Roland.

706
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,520
You got trouble at home, Jeffrey?

707
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
Yeah, there was an incident.

708
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,840
Our cat Jonathan died,
and now Cynthia wants to...

709
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,800
Sorry, kids.

710
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,440
...have sex all the time.

711
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
It's constant.

712
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,640
I'm not as young as I used to be.

713
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,520
None of us are
as young as we used to be,

714
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,760
but you gotta enjoy it while you still can

715
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,360
'cause... life's a bitch.

716
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,560
It gets us all in the end.

717
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,680
Dad, don't say that.

718
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,920
Rubes doesn't like it
when I'm being nihilistic.

719
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,240
I'm sorry, darlin'. I'll rein it in.

720
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,040
She's such a good girl,

721
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,320
so kind to me and her mum.

722
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,040
Which is why it's nice to see her happy
since she's been dating you.

723
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,680
Always going on about you.

724
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,840
Otis this, and Otis that.

725
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,080
Oh my God, Dad! Shut up!

726
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,560
What? It's normal! I used to be like that
about your mum when we first met.

727
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,960
Yeah, I used to be like that
about Cynthia too.

728
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,640
To be young.

729
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,080
Yeah, it was so nice to be young.

730
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,440
Your dad's such a lightweight.

731
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,560
- Do you wanna stay over?
- Thank you, but I should get home.

732
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,160
I should probably get home too.

733
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,760
Sorry about your cat.

734
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,560
Thanks. Yeah, he was a great cat.

735
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,200
A change in libido
is a common side-effect of grief.

736
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,680
For some people, it's a coping strategy.

737
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,920
Cynthia and me could never have kids.

738
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,840
She really wanted them,
but they just never stuck, you know.

739
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,040
So Jonathan was kinda like her son.

740
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,920
Thought she'd fall apart without him
but been the opposite.

741
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,320
She hasn't even cried.

742
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,160
Grief hits people in different ways.

743
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,800
Maybe that's why she wants
to be intimate with you all the time,

744
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,200
to avoid feeling the sadness.

745
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,040
Yeah, maybe.

746
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,120
Hey, you're kinda like
an old man in a kid's body.

747
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,760
Yeah, I get that a lot.

748
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,440
Mum said you've painted me?

749
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,280
Yeah.

750
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,480
I was gonna give it to you
when we were still friends, but, um...

751
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,520
Well, it would be a bit creepy now.

752
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Can I see it?

753
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,840
Yeah. It's, uh, just under those.

754
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,360
Okay.

755
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,400
This looks nothing like me.

756
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,400
- Mum's is pretty good though.
- Yeah, the props were her idea.

757
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,880
Thank you for getting her to stay.

758
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,240
I didn't do anything.

759
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,560
I wanted to say
that I do know you, by the way.

760
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,840
You said I didn't, but

761
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
I do.

762
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,200
I know
you still cut the crusts off your toast.

763
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,240
That you bite your nails
when you're nervous,

764
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,400
sometimes when you're feeling shy.

765
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,360
That you could run
intellectual rings around anybody,

766
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,440
but you don't because you're basically
a very good person.

767
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,760
Which is why you give me a hard time,

768
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,400
more than anyone else I've ever met,

769
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,320
because you know
that's what's gonna make me feel seen.

770
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,080
Every time I'm around you,

771
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,080
all my cells are

772
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,840
fizzy

773
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,040
and alive, and everything feels hopeful.

774
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,560
I just wish
that I could take back what I did

775
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,040
because...

776
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,120
I'm afraid I'm not gonna have you
in my life anymore.

777
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,240
You'll always be in my life.

778
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,840
But if you ever lie to me again,
I will cut your ball sack off.

779
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
Okay?

780
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Noted.

781
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,680
See you at breakfast.

782
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,520
All right?

783
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,240
- What took you so long, lover boy?
- Fucking hell!

784
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,520
Cynthia, stop!

785
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,200
I can't keep having sex with you.

786
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,720
I'm really tired!

787
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,960
And I think
we need to talk about Jonathan.

788
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,440
I don't think that I can.

789
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
Why not, love?

790
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,440
Because...

791
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,400
because it's too painful.

792
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,920
I know, Cynth.

793
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,800

It was fun.

808
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,160

809

No, but it doesn't surprise me.

00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,160
Hey, I am sorry about earlier.

812
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,280
I'm an only child.

813
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,800
I'm not very good at sharing my space,
but I am working on it.

814

I know this must be hard for you, too,
so you can borrow my records whenever.

815
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,840
Thanks, Otis. That means a lot.

816
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,440
So, um, you and Ruby
are getting pretty serious, then?

817
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,400
Maybe.

818
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,640
- Hey.
- My dad was embarrassing tonight.

819
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,920
I'm so sorry about that.

820
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,360
<i>It's fine. It's fine.

821
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,360
Yeah, he is kind of great, isn't he?

822
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,120
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
