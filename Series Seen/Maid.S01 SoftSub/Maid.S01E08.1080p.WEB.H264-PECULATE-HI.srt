00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,345
[Sean breathing heavily]

2
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,018
Hey, no.

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,272
- I've got to get home to Maddy.
- No. Come back to bed. It's so early.

4
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,361
It's barely light out.

5
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,156
I wanna take the next ferry.
Can you drive me?

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,201
Can I cook you breakfast?

7
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,663
I'll wait in the car.

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,502
[pensive music playing]

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,481
[Sean] Hey.

10
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,195
Want coffee?

11
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,909
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

12
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,537
- You okay?
- Yeah.

13
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,257
I'll wait here.

14
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,842
For what?

15
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,471
You. I was gonna
take you back to the hospital.

16
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,430
That's okay.

17
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:23,351
There's no way I'm letting you
deal with your mom on your own.

18
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,273
- Grab Maddy. We'll go as a family.
- Can we meet you at the hospital?

19
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,652
That makes no sense.
I'm here now. We could take one car.

20
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,779
I need a minute, Sean.

21
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,536
You don't owe that dork anything, Alex.
You slept at home, in your bed.

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,579
Can I just...?

23
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,685
You're awake.

24
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,317
Well, you said
you'd be home soon, ten hours ago.

25
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,485
So yes.

26
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,405
I'm sorry. I had a really weird night.

27
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,452
I saw Sean.
How hard is it to just send a text,

28
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,622
"Hey, I'm not coming home.
I'm gonna fuck my ex"?

29
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,665
Uh...

30
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,921
Something happened with my mom, actually.

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,343
She was manic, and she put her hand
through a window and severed a tendon.

32
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,011
She's in the hospital now.

33
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,431
And I'm accusing you
of being on a walk of shame.

34
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:47,018
- I'm really sorry.
- No, uh... I did sleep with Sean.

35
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm not gonna lie to you, and I'm sorry.

36
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,398
Oh. Uh...

37
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,780
No, you don't have to apologize to me.
It's not like we're a couple.

38
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:04,661
It's not like you sat here yesterday
and told me you couldn't be with anyone.

39
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,997
I really can't. I meant what I said.

40
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,791
- Unless it's Sean.
- No.

41
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,170
What is it about this guy?
Fucking peach fuzz.

42
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,005
Okay, he can make a drink.

43
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,967
I can make a skyscraper,
but you're going back to him.

44
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,552
I'm not, though.
No, I'm not going back to Sean.

45
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,762
You are.

46
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,847
- No, I'm not.
- Of course you are.

47
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,644
You were hurt, and you went to him.
You cried on him.

48
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,605
I just provided daycare.

49
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,779
That's really not what happened, Nate.
That's not what happened.

50
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:44,367
I don't wanna watch your kid for you
while you fuck Sean.

51
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,411
So...

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,082
I'm gonna have to ask you to move out.

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,295
I'm not trying to be a dick.

54
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,506
I care about you.

55
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,594
I just can't do a front-row seat.

56
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,763
No.

57
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,767
I understand.

58
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,482
I'm gonna get Maddy,
and we'll get out of here.

59
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,861
- Alex.
- Yeah?

60
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,823
Um, keep the car.

61
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,743
No. I mean...

62
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,830
You need a car, so keep the car.

63
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,587
Thank you for being so kind.

64
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,215
That's me.

65
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,926
Mr. Kind.

66
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
[pensive music playing]

67
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
- [Alex] <i>Schmariel?</i>
- [Maddy] <i>Check.</i>

68
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,905
- Mommy's stuff?
- Check.

69
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,282
- Grammy's stuff?
- Check.

70
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,116
Kisses.

71
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,079
Check.

72
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,499
Check.

73
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:28,471
[Paula] What you mean to do
and what you intend to do

74
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,972
are not the same thing!

75
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,227
I cannot be held accountable
for someone else's false intention!

76
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,146
Miss Langley,
whatever you say can and will be...

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,276
[Paula] Oh, my God! You're reading me
my rights over a motherfucking scratch!

78
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,363
- Excuse me, what's happening here?
- Get that child out of here!

79
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,866
- [Sean] Okay. I'll take her outside.
- Get her out of here! I can't do her.

80
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,247
- Uh, I'm sorry, who are you? Sorry.
- She's a fucking bitch.

81
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,835
I'm the DCR, Designated Crisis Responder.
It might be best if you waited outside.

82
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,672
This is about intent! Intent! Intent!
She's my daughter, she'll tell you!

83
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,634
All I need is my good weed
and a fucking hairbrush.

84
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,469
I'll be right with you.

85
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,595
[groans]

86
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,603
All right, Miss Langley,
I need to ask you a couple of questions.

87
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,064
Are you taking any current medication?

88
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,870
Is she under arrest?

89
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,706
No, no,
the tenant is not pressing charges.

90
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:41,169
- Why were you reading her her rights?
- I'm a court-appointed DCR.

91
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,422
I was evaluating whether or not
your mother meets the criteria

92
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,091
to be placed
on an involuntary hold or not.

93
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,260
You mean, commit her?

94
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,014
She had a severe manic episode.
She's still symptomatic.

95
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,683
Pressured speech,
delusions, irrational thought.

96
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,228
She told me she thought she owned
the house that she was breaking into.

97
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,355
Oh, she does, or she did.

98
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,484
Ah, well, she also told me
that she's the goddess Aphrodite

99
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,235
and she fucks the sun.

100
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,070
She just says that stuff.

101
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,657
Well, your mother
has refused voluntary treatment,

102
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,161
so I am filing a petition to detain her.

103
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,206
She's a danger to herself and to others.

104
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,042
She would never hurt anybody.
She's harmless.

105
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,461
Well, she hurt herself, seriously.

106
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,297
Unless you wish
to provide collateral information

107
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,093
and take responsibility for her,
then this is just what we have to do.

108
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,970
What's collateral information?

109
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,933
You tell the courts why
you think she's a good-faith volunteer.

110
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,436
You give examples of things she's done
that would make you believe

111
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,480
that she would attend
an outpatient program

112
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,900
and take her prescribed medications
while in your care.

113
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,694
In my care?

114
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,446
[Renee] We can discharge her to you,

115
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,074
if you're prepared
to give that collateral.

116
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,035
Is that something you're prepared to do?

117
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,081
I have work today. And a 3-year-old.

118
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,462
She scared me last night.

119
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,300
There is an evaluation
and treatment center in Port Orchard.

120
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,472
- How long would she be there?
- Usually 14 days, sometimes 30.

121
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,933
Do I tell her, or do you?

122
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,604
Generally, we don't inform the patient
until it's actually happening.

123
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,106
More soon.

124
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,610

Because I saw the menu, it's meatloaf.</i>

00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,830
Whatever happened to Meat Loaf?

Sorry to hear about your mom. You okay?

160
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,303
Sounds like you saw her
at a ten out of ten.

161
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,264
- Well, she's got a DCR now. That's good.
- Yeah.

162
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,643
- Maybe she'll get the help she needs.
- All right, say goodbye to Grandpa.

[Maddy] Bye, Grandpa.

And we will be praying for your mom, Alex.

There's decades' worth of blood, sweat,
and popped blisters on those things,

- so take care of them.
- Gross. Will do.

Baby, I would...

341
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,182
I would give you the skin off my bones.

342
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,769
I would drink turpentine...

343
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:30,065
before I would let a bunch of doctors
do this to you.

344
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,567
Mom.

345
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:39,616
Hey, hey, Mom, Mom, we have 23 minutes.
Can I please just talk to you? I love you.

346
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,243
I love you, and Maddy loves you.
So many people.

347
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,705
Please get this bitch out of here.
Just get this bitch out of here.

348
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,248
- Mother. Mom.
- No!

349
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,126
You need to go. No, sorry. Right now.

350
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,671
- Are you fucking kidding me? Mom!
- [door locks]

351
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,676
Hey, Yolanda.

352
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,929
Just swapping out a filter
for 351 Armstrong.

353
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,265
- Swapping out a filter, she says.
- Okay.

354
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,478
- Okay. Is that a problem?
- Of course not. Go ahead.

355
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,522
Help yourself to all my filters.

356
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,361
I'm having a really shitty day. So is
there something that you wanna say to me?

357
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:24,411
Just had a call from my clients
over at 19 Glastonbury.

358
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:30,166
She canceled last-minute last week,
which isn't like her.

359
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,128
And then, this week,
she didn't schedule at all.

360
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,549
So being the good businesswoman
that I am, I called her

361
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,343
and asked her,
why is she ghosting Value Maids

362
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,012
after five years of loyal service?

363
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,472
You know what she said?

364
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,142
I got stood up,
and you weren't gonna pay me.

365
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,396
You stole business from me.
Took money directly from my pocket.

366
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,023
I wasn't gonna be able
to pay for daycare, Yolanda.

367
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,569
- I told you I needed another shift.
- And I told you that I expected loyalty.

368
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,239
You're fired.
Leave your ferry pass. Get out!

369
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:10,206
And if I hear you contacting
a single one of my clients,

370
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,586
I will track you down, beat your ass
and take you to court. You hear me?

371
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,671
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

372
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,138
Can I get my last paycheck?

373
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,221
Not out yet.

374
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,726
Can I leave you my address
for when it is out?

375
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,311
You can go fuck yourself.

376
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,037
[pensive music playing]

377
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,680
[children shouting]

378
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:11,226
Oh, Miss Russell, your invoice.

379
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:15,688
I sent it home with Maddy's backpack
last week, but I don't think you saw it.

380
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,942
- I missed it. Thank you.
- Yeah.

381
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:23,071
There's WCCC paperwork in there too.
We need signatures from your employer.

382
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,154
You got it.

383
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:28,243
Also, it was ice cream day,
and we didn't want Maddy to go without.

384
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,370
We took it out of the petty cash.

385
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,248
- Oh, thank you. How much do I owe you?
- It's $6.

386
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,000
For ice cream?

387
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,795
Two scoops, and each kid
got three toppings.

388
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,423
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

389
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
- Thanks.
- Okay.

390
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,483
Fuck!

391
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,499
Uh, hi, I'm sorry,

392
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,003
you don't happen to have $3
that I could bum off of you for gas?

393
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,046
I can't get home. Sorry.

394
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,214
Um...

395
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,676
- Here.
- Thank you.

396
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,616
All right. Go.

397
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:51,951
No more cartoons.

398
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,621
Let's go on a hike like old times,
what do you say?

399
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,124
- We're going on a...
- Bear hunt.

400
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,419
- We're gonna catch a...
- Big one.

401
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,254
What a beautiful day.

402
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,423
- We're not scared.
- We're not scared.

403
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,051
- Oh, no, a forest.
- A forest.

404
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,679
- A big, dark forest.
- A big, dark forest.

405
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,474
Oh, no. What?

406
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,809
- We can't go over it.
- We can't go over it.

407
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,604
- We can't go under it.
- We can't go under it.

408
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,899
- [Maddy laughing]
- We're going on a...

409
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,484
I'm gonna...

410
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:27,904
I'm gonna get you.

411
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,618
Let's jump over that one.

412
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,495
You sure can. See any fairies?

413
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,748
So...

414
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,833
[gentle music playing]

415
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,379
- [Alex] Rock.
- Rocks.

416
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,677
[Alex] Here. Right here?

417
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,228
[vehicle approaching]

418
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,902
[car door opens, then closes]

419
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,789
[door opens]

420
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,709
- [Alex] Hey.
- Hey.

421
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,254
- I saved you some ziti. Are you hungry?
- Yes.

422
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,800
So how was carpentry 101?

423
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,926
Pretty cool, actually.

424
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,263
Yeah, Dwight's a cool guy.
He's got a kid Maddy's age.

425
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,934
Hank wasn't kidding
when he said he'd be tough on me.

426
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,271
I literally can't feel my fingers
or my ass right now.

427
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,070
- So it was good.
- Yeah, yeah.

428
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,572
Good.

429
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,246
I got fired today.

430
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,874
- You?
- Yeah.

431
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,459
Oh, my.

432
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,671
Well, you've gotta let me have this.
What did you do?

433
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,341
I stole a shift,
and then I pocketed the cash.

434
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,012
You embezzled? Very juicy.

435
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,139
[Sean laughing]

436
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,350
- You've been saving up, right?
- Yeah.

437
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,436
You have enough until you get
something else?

438
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:25,855
I think so, yeah.

439
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,942
I was thinking, I'm actually gonna
try to get my own cleaning clients

440
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,570
because I still have my supplies
and my car,

441
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,907
- I can probably get a vacuum secondhand.
- Makes sense.

442
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:41,579
I just have to figure out daycare
because Yolanda took my ferry pass.

443
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,332
Oh, shit. That's goodbye, Island Friends.

444
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,795
- We can't afford ferry trips every day.
- I know, but she loves it.

445
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,172
- She loves being with you more.
- Yeah.

446
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,051
But I can't clean houses full-time
and watch Maddy.

447
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,930
Well, I'm with Dwight
Monday through Friday,

448
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,265
so who else is gonna watch her?

449
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:10,858
I need to work, Sean. So I can make
my own money so that I can be independent.

450
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,527
Okay.

451
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,821
Yeah.

452
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,157
Um...

453
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,745
Could you clean on the weekends?
I'll watch Maddy.

454
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,249
That's not gonna be enough money
with you apprenticing all week.

455
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,169
- I could pick up some shifts at the bar.
- And watch Maddy all day?

456
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,674
- You're gonna be exhausted.
- Would you relax?

457
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,093
It's fine.

458
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,303
Worst-case scenario,

459
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,223
- Hank and Sharlene can watch Maddy.
- No.

460
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,184
Hank cannot watch Maddy.
That's not an option.

461
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,355
- What is with you and your dad?
- He's not a good guy.

462
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,777
He got me a job.
He's really sweet with Maddy.

463
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,780
He takes me to meetings.

464
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,576
I need you to listen to me, okay?

465
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,872
Just trust me and promise me
that he won't be near Maddy.

466
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:10,877
Okay. No Hank.
We'll figure it out ourselves.

467
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,547
I think we can.

468
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,426
Okay.

469
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,598
[emotional music playing]

470
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,686
I love these flowers.

471
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,155
[Alex] <i>You look good, Mom.</i>

472
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,201
I brought you a lipstick.

473
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:47,496
I don't care if you don't talk back.

474
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:51,292
I'm still gonna come every day
that Sean has Maddy.

475
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,836
- [Alex] We're going on a...
- Bear hunt.

476
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,881
- We're gonna catch a...
- Big one.

477
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,341
She's been asking about you.

478
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,844
- We're going on a...
- Bear hunt.

479
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:08,100
[Alex] <i>They said that she's
artistically gifted, in her preschool.</i>

480
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,188
And I was like, "Yeah, of course."

481
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,858
She's been painting with my mom
since birth.

482
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,660
Blink if you hear me.

483
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,619
Mom.

484
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,415
- [Alex] <i>We're going on a...</i>
- [Maddy] <i>Bear hunt.</i>

485
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,001
- [Alex] <i>We're gonna catch a...</i>
- [Maddy] <i>Big one.</i>

486
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,169
I'll get you.

487
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,383
- Uh-oh, what do you see?
- Trees.

488
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,356
Can I tell you a secret?

489
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,236
<i>I applied to the writing program
in Missoula.</i>

490
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:08,411
<i>It's a long shot because my writing sample
is about cleaning toilets.</i>

491
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,539
And what if I did get in?

492
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,587
What if we moved there when you get out?

493
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:25,261
<i>You could paint and hang out with Maddy.</i>

494
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,765
<i>Float down that river
with some cold beers.</i>

495
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,526
When you get better,
there's so much light waiting for you.

496
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:43,696
<i>And so much love.</i>

497
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,623
[footsteps approaching]

498
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:57,918
Hey.

499
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,588
- I made you a grilled cheese.
- Thanks.

500
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,648
Are you too tired to do this?

501
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,775
[chuckles]

502
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,195
- I don't need to be awake to bartend.
- So, um...

503
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:32,828
My phone's almost out of minutes,
and we're out of milk and snacks.

504
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,414
- I have a coupon, but...
- How much?

505
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,083
Uh...

506
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,213
Well, I also need money
for gas, so, like, $50.

507
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,176
Uh, do we have to keep your phone on?
Can we just share mine?

508
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,390
I've put my number on the cleaning ads.

509
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,601
- People need to be able to call me.
- Yeah, but nobody is.

510
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,771
I mean... Right?

511
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,359
I'm trying.

512
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,948
Nobody wants weekend cleans.
Everybody wants weekdays and referrals.

513
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,077
Well, I'll have cash tonight,
and we'll figure it out. Okay?

514
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,370
[vehicle approaching]

515
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,453
Fuck.

516
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,622
What?

517
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,040
- Nah...
- What?

518
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,626
Your dad's here.

519
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,838
Stay here, okay?

520
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,763
[Hank] Hey, stranger.

521
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,391
You wanna give me a hand?

522
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,351
What's all this?

523
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,149
Oh, this is just some of Alex's stuff
from the apartment with the black mold.

524
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,485
I told her I'd go back for it
with my truck,

525
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,404
and I do what I say I'm going to do.

526
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,406
[Sean] Should have called first, Hank.

527
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,990
[Hank] Right.

528
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,867
Guilty.

529
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,162
Came to get eyes on you too.

530
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,872
Drinking again?

531
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,665
No.

532
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,796
- Haven't seen you in any of the meetings.
- I've been working a lot.

533
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:12,178
- I thought we got you out of bartending.
- I'm doing both for a while now.

534
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:17,266
Well, there's a meeting at the VFW
in half an hour, so...

535
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,479
- Come on, we can go together.
- No, thanks.

536
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,778
I've been where you're at before.
But you can't do it alone.

537
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,155
Okay, you've got to...

538
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,324
You've got to tap into something stronger.

539
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,034
You can't come by here anymore.

540
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,122
Who says? You?

541
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,831
Or her?

542
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,416
Her.

543
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:45,961
But I'm with her.

544
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,045
Mm.

545
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,547
Is she with you?

546
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,219
Because you're not
going to meetings any more,

547
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,054
she's got you working two jobs.

548
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,222
Doesn't seem like it.

549
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,848
You done?

550
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,311
You need to get yourself to a meeting.

551
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,117
Well, that was fun.

552
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,037
Being an asshole to somebody
without knowing why.

553
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,622
[vehicle pulling away]

554
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,721
Do you wanna wait up for me?

555
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,476
All right, I'll hurry back.

556
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,479
I'm gonna do some fucking
lightning-speed bartending.

557
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,273
Woo-hoo!

558
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,404
We're going on a...

559
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,613
Bear hunt.

560
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,615
We're going on a...

561
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,700
Bear hunt.

562
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,410
We're gonna catch a...

563
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,453
Oh, look, you found one. See it?

564
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:02,788
[cell phone ringing]

565
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,459
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

566
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,503
<i>Uh, who is this?</i>

567
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,588
Regina.

568
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,550
Some random girl is here from Value Maids.
I got your number from her. Where are you?

569
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,385
I got fired.

570
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,012
<i>So?</i>

571
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,847
<i>I'm not loyal.</i>

572
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,182
I am home. With a newborn.

573
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,311
And this woman is totally incompetent.

574
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,564
How soon can you be here?

575
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,400
<i>I have Maddy today.</i>

576
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,902
How about tomorrow?

577
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,532
I can't afford the ferry.

578
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,912
I can offer you three shifts a week.

579
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,624
Twenty dollars an hour,
15 hours guaranteed.

580
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,418
<i>You can clean
and help me take care of Leo.</i>

581
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,005
<i>I will provide a ferry pass and supplies.</i>

582
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,088
<i>How's that?</i>

583
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,466
Yes, yes, yes.

584
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,383
Hello?

585
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,676
[call drops]

586
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,971
- Hello?
- Regina?

587
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,808
Okay, Mad.

588
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,894
We're going on a bear hunt.

589
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,480
We're going to get some phone minutes.

590
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,657
[Alex] <i>Yes, I'll be there tomorrow. Yes.</i>

591
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,034
What number is this?

592
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,245
This is Alex, sorry, I'm at a payphone.
My phone ran out of minutes.

593
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,163
What?

594
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,124
<i>I'm at a payphone,</i>

595
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,711
<i>but you can e-mail me the ferry pass
and I can print it out at the library.</i>

596
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,799
What's your e-mail?

597
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,640
Hi, Magda, how's it going?

598
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:45,808
Sign in here?

599
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,476
Wait here, please.

600
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,604
Miss Langley's daughter is here. Okay.

601
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,110
- Miss Langley's daughter?
- [Alex] Hiya.

602
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,906
We dropped the hold on your mother.
She was discharged at 1:45 today.

603
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,200
- What do you mean?
- The DCR determined

604
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,036
she no longer met the criteria
to be detained.

605
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,081
The DCR can just change their mind?

606
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,918
If collateral information
is given from immediate family.

607
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,504
What family? I'm her only family.

608
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,922
A Basil Desmond.

609
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,925
He gave collateral
and she was discharged into his care.

610
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:23,804
How the fuck did Basil know she was here?
Was she allowed to call him?

611
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,639
It's not a prison, Miss Russell.

612
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,477
[Sean] Maybe it's good.

613
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,689
You've been responsible for your mom
your entire life.

614
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,775
If she wants to run off with Basil,
what can you do?

615
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,360
I don't feel like doing this.

616
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,948
- I'll just drop you guys off and go home.
- No. Everyone wants to see you.

617
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,451
Tania was your best friend for years.

618
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:49,329
- I should have given collateral.
- Hey, don't beat yourself up.

619
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,750
She's not your child.
You can't force her to do anything.

620
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,419
And you got a job today.

621
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,132
Island Friends agreed
to let Maddy come part-time

622
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,093
so I can drop her off,
clean Regina's and then pick her back up.

623
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,429
Yeah, see? You rocked it.

624
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,138
For Maddy.

625
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,559
[indistinct chatter]

626
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,188
Can I have your attention, please?

627
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,398
I'm gonna say a few words about Ethan.

628
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,816
[all clamoring]

629
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,490
The man who has done nothing right
since I met him in the second grade.

630
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,366
Including second grade itself,

631
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,868
which he repeated twice.

632
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,829
- Yeah, true story.
- [Ethan] Dick.

633
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,372
Nineteen years I've known this guy.

634
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,917
I thought I knew
what his life would look like,

635
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,835
and I thought I knew exactly who he was.

636
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,671
But what I didn't know
was the power of Tania.

637
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,216
- Thank you.
- [crowd applauding]

638
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,425
Thank you.

639
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:48,263
Yeah. She smoothed his rough edges.
You encouraged him to get an education.

640
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,058
Got him to stop wearing
those lime-green Crocs.

641
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,184
[all laughing]

642
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,062
- Yes.
- [Sean] Well done.

643
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,690
You saw what he could be.
Helped him get there.

644
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,277
So let's all raise a glass to Ethan...

645
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,114
who is doing what we all told him to do
from day one:

646
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,908
Marry this magnificent woman.

647
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,159
Cheers.

648
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,410
[all cheering]

649
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,000
[rock music playing over speakers]

650
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,170
- That was really great.
- Thanks.

651
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,673
You can relax.

652
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,467
Hey, come here.
That's it, come here, sweetie.

653
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,099
Hey. You.

654
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,478
Thanks for coming.

655
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,481
I wasn't sure you would.

656
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:45,070
Me neither, but then I was like,
"There's probably gonna be free food..."

657
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,947
Yeah.

658
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,700
Congratulations.

659
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,203
I love that you did it at City Hall.
Very cool.

660
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,331
Yeah, with the reception in the bar
I've worked in for six years.

661
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,666
Very romantic.

662
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:59,001
- Amazing.
- Yeah...

663
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,879
Yeah, we're trying to save money.
I'm, uh...

664
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,338
pregnant.

665
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,341
- Oh, my God, wow!
- Yeah.

666
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,634
Congratulations!

667
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,803
That's amazing. Wow.

668
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,598
Yeah. [laughs]

669
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,852
So you and Sean are back on?

670
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,937
Oh, no. Uh...

671
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,981
No, I'm just staying there
for a little bit.

672
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:26,320
Oh. Does he know that?
He's been saying the opposite to Ethan.

673
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,280
[Alex] Um...

674
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,490
Um...

675
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,578
Can I use your printer?
I need to print my ferry pass.

676
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,121
At my wedding?

677
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,665
Yep. Sorry, my phone's out of minutes.

678
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,834
Yeah, my iPad's behind the bar.

679
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,271
[laughs]

680
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,655
What are you smiling about?

681
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:11,239
I...

682
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:12,950
I got a scholarship to Missoula,

683
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,035
the same as four years ago,
I just found out.

684
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,536
No fucking way.

685
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,455
That's awesome!

686
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,499
Oh, my God.

687
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,334
What's awesome?

688
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,378
Well, this smarty-pants here

689
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,422
just got a scholarship to Missoula, again.

690
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,757
[Ethan] Yeah, get it.

691
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,301
When did you apply?

692
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,389
I reapplied a few weeks ago. It was free.

693
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,641
Why didn't you tell me?

694
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,020
Wasn't anything to tell. I literally
just found out 30 seconds ago.

695
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,147
You didn't think
taking my daughter to Montana

696
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,941
was something that we should discuss?

697
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,026
Um...

698
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,363
Hmm?

699
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,034
[pensive music playing]

700
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,623
I don't know why you're acting this way.

701
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,874
How else should I react?

702
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,002
You could be happy for me?

703
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,630
I'm working two jobs, busting my ass
to be a better person for you.

704
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:09,881
For absolutely no reason.

705
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,634
You had a getaway car
parked outside the entire time.

706
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,554
- That's not what this is.
- Oh, what am I doing any of this for?

707
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,514
I really don't even...

708
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,976
Do you have any idea
how hard it is not to fucking drink!

709
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,352
You're gonna wake up Maddy.

710
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,774
I thought we were building something
together, as a family.

711
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,071
It's a writing program, Sean.

712
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,033
- This has nothing to do with you.
- It has nothing to do with me?

713
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,367
Is Nate going with you?

714
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,495
- [laughs] No. No.
- You say that like I should know better.

715
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,290
But I don't know shit.
I don't know what you're applying to,

716
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:47,544
I don't know what your plan is without me.
This whole thing is fucking fucked!

717
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,629
Get in the car!

718
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,801
Get in the car!

The chair of the English Department

723
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,981
said my stories were really good.

724
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,541
Sean.

725
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,209
Sean.

726
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,711

Where's my car?

728

729
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
What?

730
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,719
Nate's car.

[clears throat]

732
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:08,185
- What are you talking about?
- I gave it back to the prick.

733
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,355
I'm sick of looking at another man's car
in my driveway.

734
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,066
You didn't do that. You didn't do that.

735
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,027
- You gave it back to him?
- Yeah.

736
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,571
No. No.

737
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,365
- Look, if he wants to do charity work...
- No, no!

738
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,243
- ...he could donate it to the Red Cross.
- Sean! That's my car!

739
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,913
That is my life. That is my only way
for me to leave here!

740
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:29,497
Sean, that is the only way

741
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,042
- for me to do anything...
- [yelling] I'm late for work!
