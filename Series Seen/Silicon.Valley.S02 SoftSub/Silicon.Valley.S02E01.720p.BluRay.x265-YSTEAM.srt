00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,731
Peter Gregory.

in our new campaign

169
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,408
heralding the upcoming release of Nucleus

170
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,164
this January at CES.

171
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,161
- Any questions?
- I have a question.

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,241
That was horrible.

173
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,522
I just got humiliated
by a fucking teenager at TechCrunch Disrupt,

174
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,365
and you give me this tampon ad?

175

- I think she has cancer.

177
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,204
At least that's how I read it.

178
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,805
I don't care what kind of disease she had!

179
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,044
All I care about is that
Nucleus is better than Pied Piper.

180
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,770
Hendricks just left us all in the dust.

181
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,124
If we get this wrong,

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,601
we could blow
the business opportunity of a lifetime!

183
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,206
Data creation is exploding.

184
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,161
With all the selfies and useless files
people refuse to delete on the cloud,

185
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,885
92% of the world's data
was created in the last two years alone.

186
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,041
At the current rate,

187
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,170
the world's data storage capacity
will be overtaken by next spring.

188
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,641
It will be nothing short of a catastrophe.

189
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,770
Data shortages, data rationing,
data black markets.

190
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,401
Someone's compression
will save the world from data-geddon,

191
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,121
and it sure as hell better be Nucleus
and not goddamn Pied Piper!

192
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,290
I don't know about you people,

193
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,646

194
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,805

a better place better than we do.

There's just been a lot of "geddons" lately.

197

That's true.
"Snow-mageddon," "car-mageddon."

198
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,528
There's that movie Armageddon.

199
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,688
Laurie, you wanted to see me?

200
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,808
Monica, come in, come in.
I'm sure you've heard by now

201
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,723
that I've been named
our new managing partner.

<font color="#404040">MONICA:</font> Yes. Congratulations.

203
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,763
Did the limited partners tell you
how they made their decision?

204
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,168
Oh. They looked at the portfolio performances

205
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,481
of each of the senior partners
over the last several funds,

206
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,086
and my numbers were,
objectively, the most favorable.

207
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,764
Therefore, I was selected.

208
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,482
Yeah, it's just managing partner
is all about meeting with people

209
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,369
and interacting with people.

210
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,329
You can sit down if you want to.
Do you want to?

211
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,050
- Oh...
- Or should we stand?

212
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,964
Uh... I... Whatever...

213
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,041
- I'm standing...
- Okay.

214
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,281
But you don't have to.

215
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,770
- Okay.
- Would it make you feel awkward to sit?

216
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,251
I'm okay to stand.

217
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,086
- Monica...
- Of course.

218

Peter Gregory is dead.

219
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,804
Yes, I know.

220
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,169
On a personal note, his death is very sad.

221
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,084
But on a professional level, it's untenable.

222
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,321
I've been reviewing his files.

223
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,880
He was pursuing a number
of extremely dubious positions.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,642
Are you aware that we own
a $30 million ostrich farm in Morocco,

225
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,644
or that we are the majority stakeholders

226
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,400
in three companies that
specialize in invisibility?

227
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,282
This box is filled with napkins covered
with notes detailing Peter's conviction

228
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,291
that genetically-modified cranberry fungus
would become the next cotton.

229
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,448
- That... That one I remember.
- Yes.

230
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,971
- Monica.
- Mmm-hmm.

231
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,570
Peter Gregory is dead.

232
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,530
- Yes.
- We need to seem competitive,

233
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,011
now more than ever,

234
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,289
to our investors as well
as to the industry at large.

235
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,361
Well, I mean,

236
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,411
Pied Piper is probably the hottest
early investment in town right now,

237
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
and we have them.

238
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,450
Do we?

239
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,568
But why then are they speaking to other firms
about investing in their Series A?

240
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,450
No, no.
I just told them to sit tight for a day or two

241
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,760
until we sorted things out.

242
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,050
It seems that that advanced
a sense of uncertainty,

243
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,327
and now we're at risk of losing their round.

244
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,846
This could jeopardize the firm

245
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,890
and, by extension, your career here, Monica,

246
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,450

Richard, look, we all know
about your amazing compression rate,

throw money at an algorithm

Okay. Well,

333
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,326
thank you for meeting with us.

334
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,289
We have a bunch of these things to go to,

335
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,091
hopefully with more tasteful artwork.

336
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,642
And your logo looks like a sideways vagina.

337
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,291
I find that to be racist, don't you?

338
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,961
Okay, here's my concern...

339
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,801
Here's my concern.
Who the hell picked out that shirt for you?

340
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,041
What?

341
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,321
Oh, I see. With the pants.

342
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,085
So I guess it's a whole thing.

343
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,730
My wife picked these out.

344
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,171
Then you married poorly.

345
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,330
Do you care about Pied Piper?

346
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,290
Do I care about Pied Piper? Well, of course.

347
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,681
Cause if you do, I'm not seeing it.

348
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,647
In fact, what I think I'm seeing
is the human equivalent of a flaccid penis.

349
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,411
"Flak-sid." It's actually pronounced "flak-sid."

350
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,891
Not a lot of people know that.

351
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,769
Well, we are definitely interested,

352
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,366
but I think we need to...

353
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,568
I'm sorry. ls something wrong?

354
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,531
No, this is all wrong.

355
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,887
I am sensing a general lack of vision.

356
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,690
Your muffins smell like shit.

357
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,444
So do your ideas.

358
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,050
One of you is the least attractive person
I've ever seen,

359
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,009
and I'm not gonna say who.

360
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,881
Should we leave or should you?

361
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,328
We just got offered eight at 40.

362
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,970
We're five for five, gentlemen.

363
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,646
And Galveston Capital Fund
and Yountville Ventures called.

364
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,882
They want to move their meetings up
before everyone else.

365
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,725
Hey, let me try.
I want to be rude at this next one.

366
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,040
Go for it.

367
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,406
So, with some proper funding,

368
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,165
we should be able to get
a functioning beta in time for CES.

369
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,527
And if you don't fund us,

370
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,728
you're a fucking slut.

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,160
<font color="#DF01D7">(SNIFFING)</font> Oh...

372
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,766
What's that smell? Is that a fart?

373
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,000
Are you a farter?

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,050
Now, can I have a pastry?
Or are you guys gonna eat 'em all?

375
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,323
'Cause you're gonna get fat.

376
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,970
It's not your fault, Richard.
This is just something that can't be taught,

377
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,567
so leave the next one to me.
I can feel a big one coming on.

378
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,641
What are you gonna do?

379
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,362
I'm not sure yet, but give me room.

380
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,966
There's something inside of me
that has to come out,

381
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,565
and who am I to stop it?

382

384
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,404
He put his balls on the table?

385
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,608
- Right on the table.
- On purpose?

386
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,206
I don't see how it could be by accident.

387
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,443
Richard, I just got an email
from the guys at Midland-Oak.

388
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,887
Apparently, there is a line, and I crossed it...

389
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,805
The line between $12 and $15 million!

390
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,246
Ba-bam!

391
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,970
Midland-Oak's offerjust came in.

392
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,443
Gentlemen, we are valued at 75 million,
fully diluted.

393
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,721
Are you shitting me?

394
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,404
Take a look at these term sheets.

395
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,602
There is a linear correlation

396
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,330
between how intolerable I was...

397
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,044

398

Hey, YOU guys. Um...

399
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,124
This is Laurie Bream,
the new managing partner at Raviga.

400
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,483
Oh, uh... Hi. I'm Richard Hendricks.

401
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,404
Yes. I recognize you from your photograph.

402
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,529
- It's very nice to meet you in person.
- Yeah.

403
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,681
Okay, so we did that.

404
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,047
Gentlemen, I am aware
of the degree of interest

405
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,246
you are receiving from other firms.

406
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,450
I am aware that participation in your Series A
will require a very competitive offer,

407
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,444
but for numerous reasons,
I believe it to be the prudent decision.

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,130
Now I am presenting you with this.

409
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,810
$20 million at $100 million valuation?

410
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,689
I don't... Uh...

411
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,366
This is way more than any other offer.

412
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,521
Correct.

413
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,000
That is very much intentional.

414
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,210
So, I believe that satisfies your requirements?

415
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,681
Monica will arrange a time
to formalize the details.

416
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,330
Thank you. Have a good day.

417
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,400
Uh, thank you.

418
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,921
Yes.

- Don't take this deal.
- What?

438
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,051
You are worth half that at best.

439
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,568
Oh, wow. Thanks for the compliment.

440
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,126
No. The credit to you guys.
You negotiated your asses off,

441
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,567
but this is a classic runaway valuation.

442
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,050
What's wrong with that?

443
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,206
Pied Piper will be tied to this crazy valuation
that you will never be able to live up to.

444
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,128
If you don't keep increasing
in value in the next round,

445
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,521
if you have a down round, you are fucked.

446
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,604
It is the kiss of death for a young CEO.

447
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,366
You want to start with a realistic valuation
and grow at a reasonable pace.

448
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,968
Okay, well, if it's such a shitty deal,
then why did your boss offer it to us?

449
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,088
Because she's competitive as hell.

450
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,970
She needs Pied Piper
to keep Raviga afloat, Richard.

451
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,690
- Okay.
- Look, I respect Laurie,

452
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,805
but this is the exact type of thing
Peter never did.

453
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,128
Richard, come on. I own shares in Pied Piper.

454
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,282
If this high evaluation
was good in the long-term,

455
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,249
would I be standing here, risking my job?

456

Don't take our offer.

457
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,007
Maybe go with the lowest offer you got.

458
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,809

What?

Well, what if you could've gone to someone

479
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,126
and asked for less than
what they offered that first round?

480
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,602
Like, you mean, negotiating them down?

481
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,049
- Yeah.
- Can you even do that?

482
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,090
- Well, yeah. I mean, why not?
- Yeah, but...

483
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,202
I mean, I guess, technically, I could have.

484
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,327
Mmm...

485
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,646
Huh.

486
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,486
Yeah, I suppose you could argue
that it might've been easier

487

to hit more realistic benchmarks

488
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,846
and reach cash flow break-even.

489
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,285
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

490
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,763
And then, <font color="#DF01D7">(SIGHS)</font>
we wouldn't have faced that down round.

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,648
I'd probably still have my girlfriend...

502
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,566
- Fuck!
- Okay.

503
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,689
Why the fuck didn't anyone tell me
I could take less?

504
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,842
I don't know. I don't know.

505
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,126
Ideas come up and then...

506
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,611
Fuck!

507
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,206
I'll take a cab, so I'll leave you to it.

508
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,520
Thanks for meeting me here.

Richard.

511
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,724
Richard, I'm Laurie Bream.
I was inside your home yesterday.

512
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,723
Have you made a decision
regarding our proposal?

513
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,045
Yeah, yeah, we'll go with you guys,
but we need to renegotiate the terms.

514
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,169
I'm afraid that's untenable.
We're offering as much money as we can.

515
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,443
Uh, no, no, we wanna go lower.
We want less... A lot less, actually.

516
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,367
We'll go with Raviga

517
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,286
if you guys do $10 million
at a $50 million valuation,

518
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,771
not 20 at 100.

519
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,845
I think this is more reasonable,

520
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,681
and it's my final offer. Take it or leave it.

521
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,000
I was not anticipating this,

522
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,924
but I think it will be workable from our end.

523
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,843
And one more thing,
Monica votes for Raviga's board seat.

524
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,521
Certainly that seems unimportant.

525
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,448
I will telephone your lawyer tomorrow,
and we can speak about the relevant details.

526
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,726
Good.

he was not disappointed in Snapchat.</i>

541

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,168
