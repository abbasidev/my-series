I think my aid in helping you achieve this

164
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,611
is what inspired me
to start my own incubator.

165
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,411
Uh, so, Richard, you ready for this?

166
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,970
Oh, yeah. I think so. Yeah...

167
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,008
Double-A, we are psyched.

168
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,560
And we can do whatever you need.

169
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,971
Okay, thanks, Kool-Aid.

170
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,168
Kool-Aid? What's that? Are you Kool-Aid?

171
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,924
Yeah, it's just a term of endearment.

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,606
You know, nickname.
That's how we used to rock it back in the day

173
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,842
'cause I was cool and supportive.

174
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,003
Yeah. Oh hey, guys, this is Gina,
she's one of our event managers.

175
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,766
Hey, Gina, can you take Dinesh
and Gilfoyle to the data center, please?

176
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,490
Sure. You wanna follow me?

177
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,688
Only if we get hats, Gina.

178
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,364
You can just take mine.

179
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,609
Did you see that? She gave me her hat.

180
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,160
Pretend you've seen a woman before.

181
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,730
Are those Homicide drinks for free?

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,484
Uh, yeah. Knock yourself out.

183
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,925
Homicide!

184
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,725
Is there any way that it could be maybe
more like just you and me talking,

185
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,245
and not Erlich?

186
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,849
What do you mean? Aren't you guys friends?
I thought you go way back.

187
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,251
We do. But...

188
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,283
<font color="#DF01D7">(WHISPERING)</font>
To be honest, I could never stand the guy.

189
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,609
I mean, just hearing his voice
again is giving me PTSD.

190
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,727
Right. But you just called him cool.

191
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,441
- No, I called him Kool-Aid. We all did.
- Right.

192
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,000
Because he's like
the Kool-Aid pitcher from the ads.

193
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,969
As in, every fucking time
we were hanging out without him,

194
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,530
he would come smashing through a wall.

195
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,806
But you still hung outwith him.

196
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,850
Yeah, 'cause we were 19,
and he had weed and beer.

197
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,809
But even drunk and high I couldn't take it.

198
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,242
I mean, it's like he's fucking allergic
to letting other people talk.

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,890
It's like he's always gotta
say something. You know?

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,291

You're obviously Pakistani,
but the name Dinesh is Indian, isn't it?

205

Yeah. Wow. That's exactly right.

206
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,922
You know, most people, ignorant people,

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,367

those are two separate countries.

210
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,083
My dad was stationed in Karachi
when I was a kid.

211
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,409
It was a beautiful place,
full of beautiful people.

212
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,404

all these killer lines coming to me.

218

219
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,480
She likes me, right?

220
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,005
Yeah, she's totally into you.

221
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,008
Just not as into you
as she is into that guy's mouth.

222
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,926
He's definitely gonna fuck her later,
and she's not gonna think of you

223
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,126
while it's happening.

224
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,441
God damn it. Fuck.

225
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,689

Guys, this is Blaine.

230
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,324
He's the guy doing the stunt.

231
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,405
Blaine, these are the genius coders
who are helping us with the live stream.

232
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,131
- They're rock stars.
- Okay.

233
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,247
- So this is the car you're jumping?
- Yes, it is.

234
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,368
And that's what your ramp's gonna look like?

235
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,611
- Yeah.
- Cool. Well, have you...

236
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,047
Yeah, and because
I know that you're gonna ask,

237
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,724
yes, I've done this before.

238
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,451
And yes, it's fucking dangerous.

239
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,762
Listen, I got a lot of work
to do to get this right.

240
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,171
Okay?

241
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,891
Okay.

242
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,847
Hey, you see what I saw?

243
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,850
Yeah, I saw.
He's got the velocity calculated wrong.

244
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,890
It's for a flat plane.
He doesn't account for the curve in the ramp.

245
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,770
Exactly. He's probably
used to doing straight ramps.

246
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,764
I mean, the chart says he's gonna
launch at 81 miles per hour,

247
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,649
-but it's going to be more like...
- Under 70.

248
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,765
The downforce is ridiculous.

249
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,605
He's gonna lose speed
and hit the side of that wall.

250
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,607
- And die.
- So we should probably...

251
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,090
Okay. All right.

252
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,969
Hey, uh, Blaine?

253
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,531
- One small thing.
- <font color="#404040">BLAINE:</font> No.

254
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,840
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glasses.

255
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,083
'Cause I told you once already,
and I was very clear.

256
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,448
I am too fucking busy to deal with you.

257
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,529
Okay? I'm just being cool here.

258
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,886
All right?

259
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,642
What do we do here?

260
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,250
This is a tough one.

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,844
So, Richard, in terms of a player window,
what do you see?

262
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,526
- Well, um, I think it's pretty straightforward.
- <font color="#404040">ERLICH:</font> I'll handle this, Richard.

263
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,921
- You don't have to.
- The whole reason we're doing this, friend,

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,206
is for branding value.

265
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,408
So we're gonna need a banner that says

266
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,687
"Powered by Pied Piper"
underneath the video window.

267
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,048
It doesn't have to be too big,
but you don't want it to be too small either.

268
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,249
Although, there's nothing
small about Homicide, Double-A.

269
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,810
At least as far as I can tell.

270
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,690
Also, if it's, if it's possible, what we'd like to...

271
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,125
Let me stop you right there, Richard.

272
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,328
We're gonna need to have our logos
on the car, Blaine's suit, his helmet.

273
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,449
If he wants to get a Flash tattoo
or something on his neck,

274
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,646
that's on him.

00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,205
So, Richard...

279
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,406
- Yes?
- Yeah?

280
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,882
Do you think you can
make the preview window full resolution?

- Richard can give you whatever you need.
- Yes...

282
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,923

283
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,370

that I've got somewhere else to be.

284

All right. Well, Double-A, I'll see you soon.

285
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,605

and we'll check you later.

- Richard, what's going on?
- What do you mean?

290
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,481
I'm catching kind of a vibe.

291
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,044
A weird vibe with you and Double-A.

292
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,645
Right. That. Well...

293
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,291
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Richard.
I don't think he likes you.

294
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,564
I mean, he literally rolled his eyes at you.

295
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,888
Why don't you just trust me on this one?

296
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,406
Let Kool-Aid do the talking tomorrow.

297
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,327
Take this stuff.
I'm gonna grab a couple more drinks

298
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,561
and another hat.

299
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,085
I'm gonna get a box.

300

<font color="#404040">GAVIN:</font> This is a total fucking disaster.

301
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,404
If my engineers had just
told me they weren't ready,

302
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,721
I never would have
pushed for this live stream.

303
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,441
Even worse, now I hear
those little Pied Piper fuckers

304
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,251
are doing their own live stream
with Homicide.

305
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,289
- The energy drink?
- Yes.

306
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,681
Meanwhile, I've demanded
to see internal testing

307
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,047
from every facet of the Nucleus platform.

308
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,885
So I can see for myself where I stand.

309
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,567
Because all I hear
from everybody is good news.

310
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,847
Have I just surrounded myself
with sycophants,

311
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,366
who are just telling me
whatever I want to hear,

312
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,249
regardless of the truth?

313
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,726
No.

314
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,884
Thank you, Denpok.
I really needed to hear that.

315
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,242
This might be morbid,
but the cold, hard fact is

316
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,529
that if Blaine dies on our live stream,
this could be good for us.

317
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,524
I mean, we'd get a lot more traffic.

318
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,082
Well, and it would probably lead to
calls for regulations in the stunt industry.

319
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,642
So, in the long term, we're saving lives.

320
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,728
Although, there is the moral problem
with letting him die.

321
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,488
Though he did tell us to shut up.

322
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,525
And his name is Blaine.

323
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,448
And Gina is super hot.

324
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,289
And this would make her single.

325
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,089
She'd probably need consoling,
so there's an opportunity.

326
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,491
Qpportunity.

327
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,329
DINESHI Should We SWOT this?

328
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,366
Bereaved women do tend to act out sexually.

329
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,169
Yeah, so that's a strength.

330
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,210
<i>- Hey, Kool-Aid!
- Yeah!</i>

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,206
And? So?

332
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,764
And? It...

333
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,608
it wasn't meant to be a flattering nickname.

334
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,250
It was an insult.

335
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,089
I'm not sure I agree with that.

336
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,084
I mean, the dancing pitcher
breaks through walls

337
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,004
to give tasty beverages to kids in need.

338
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,368
Why would you infer from this
that Double-A doesn't like me?

339
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,411
Well, um, I wasn't inferring anything.

340
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,051
He told me to my face that he doesn't like you.

341
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,770
But why wouldn't he like me?

342
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,004
Well, uh...

343
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,811
You have a tendency sometimes to...

344
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,803
Why on earth wouldn't he like me?

345
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,123
Because, Erlich, you tend to not let...

346
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,202
I was his mentor. You know?

347
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,282
You know, there's no remote possibility...

348
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,203
Because you don't let people talk!

349
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,291
It just happened.

350
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,361
Um...

351
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,645
And he told me that if you came tomorrow

352
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,849
that he would pull the plug
on the whole live stream, so...

353
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,601
<font color="#DF01D7">(SIGHS)</font>

354
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,800
I see.

355
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,646
Sorry.

356
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,722
Are you done talking now?

357
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,046
Yes.

358
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,166
Do Dinesh and Gilfoyle know about this?

359
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,565
- No, I came straight to you.
- What about Jared?

360
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,721
Nope.

361
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,889
Okay, here's what you need to do.

362
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,931
You need to go in tomorrow,
and you need to do that live stream.

363
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,566
And put my feelings aside,
you know, don't quit on account of me.

364
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,327
I wasn't gonna... I wasn't gonna quit.

365
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,971
There is something you should know, though.

366
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,889
Aaron Anderson wasn't
very well liked in college.

367
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,645
In fact, people used to
call him Double-Asshole.

368
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,364
So watch out for that guy.

369
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,484
Are you sure you're okay with this?

370
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,163
Yes, Richard.
It's time for me to be the bigger man.

371
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,730
The cooler man.

372
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,681
I am Kool-Aid, after all.

373
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,761
Ladies and gentlemen, for the last 90 minutes
you have had an opportunity

374
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,640
to explore a standard Hooliphone
upgraded with a brand new operating system

375
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,881
called Nucleus.

376
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,041
<i>Thank you all for being here,</i>

377
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,567
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie, Ramén.

378
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,207
I'd like to get everyone's first impressions.

379
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,687
Who'd like to jump in? Anyone?

380
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,364
How about you, Ramén?

381
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,726
It's just stupid.

382
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,683
<i>Okay, so Ramén feels the phone is stupid.</i>

383
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,571
Could you elaborate, Ramén?

384
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,890
Stupid how?
Please be as specific as possible, Ramén.

385
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,289
Well, it's slow.

386
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,929
The apps keep quitting on me.

387
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,810
I tried to watch a movie,
and it kept freezing up.

388
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,811
And when I'm typing, like, there's a delay.

389
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,769
Then all the letters pop up at once.

390
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,605
You took a good phone
and you made it all, like, shitty.

391
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,001
Keep in mind, I didn't design the phone.

392
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,731
- It pissed me off.
- I appreciate your honesty, Ramén.

393
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,404
That's just one guy's opinion.

394
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,086
Who else feels this product is stupid?

395
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,722
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie.

396
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,885
And did it piss off anyone else?

397
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,843
- Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie.
- Okay.

398
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,367
Christina, how bad is this? Be honest.

399
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,368
Is this Windows Vista bad?

400
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,846
It's not iPhone 4 bad, is it?

401
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,610
Fuck. Don't tell me this is Zune bad.

402
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,804
I'm sorry, Gavin.

403
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,484
It's Apple Maps bad.

404
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,324
And who else felt this product is messed up?

405
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,248
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana...

406
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,044
GAVIN; <font color="#DF01D7">(YELLING)</font> Fuck!

407
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,601
I'm sorry for the disturbance,
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana...

408
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,001
So I can definitely get you
full res on the preview window.

409
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,088
- Oh, sweet.
- Cool. I'll get right on that.

410
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,891
You see how much smoother this all runs
without Erlich hanging around?

411
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,570
Right, yeah.

412
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,361
Hey, did you ever send me the mockup
for the logo placement of the player window?

413
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,841
Seriously, you should think
about dropping that guy.

414
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,321
But what do I know?
I just built a billion-dollar company.

415
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,004
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

416
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,367
But about the mockup
for the logo placement...

417
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,488
Hey, I gotta go Skype
with my European distributor.

418
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,125
Keep cranking it, okay?

419
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,611
Sure, uh, will do.

420
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,566
Excuse me.

421
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,086
That's not the final graphic
for the live stream, is it?

422
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,401
Yep. Double-A signed off on it.

423
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,768
- Just that? There's nothing else?
- <font color="#404040">MAN:</font> Nope.

424
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,447
Hmm.

425
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,360
Blaine doesn't die,
but he is horribly incapacitated.

426
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,286
And then while he's in the hospital
he gets a flesh-eating virus,

427
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,964
and then he dies.

428
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,964
Well, obviously...

429
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,087
His incessant suffering will be a strength.

430
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,164
But our ability to enjoy it is an opportunity.

431
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,005
What if before he dies

432
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,525
Gina catches the virus?

433
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,241
And then she spreads it
from her vagina to your penis.

434
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,482
Wait, so in this scenario,

435
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,483
I get to have sex with Gina?

436
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,641
That's an opportunity.

437
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,246
- Okay, how about this?
- I'm listening.

438
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,046
We let Blaine die,

439
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,242
but then he's not around
to stop someone else

440
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,766
from committing
some huge fucked-up act of evil?

441
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,002
- The "Kill Hitler" scenario.
- Right.

446
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,001
I got something I gotta say.

447

Listen. I know that I was really rude
to both of you yesterday.

448
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,850
It's just, um...

449
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,930
When I got a stunt coming up,
I'm a bundle of nerves,

450
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,049
and sometimes I can
take that out on other people.

451
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,208
You know, even with all the support
that I get from Gina and our kids.

452
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,685
- Kids.
- I don't know why.

453
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,602
But... And then again,

454
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,604
I'm a guy who needs to
risk his life jumping over stuff.

455
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,523
So, what's that all about, right? <font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLES)</font>

456
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,844
You know, actuallyjust an hour ago
I spotted an error in my math.

457
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,611
Would have had me smeared
across the side of that building.

458
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,801
Anyway, now I'm just totally rambling.

459
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,049
Typical Blaine.

460
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,886
What I wanted to say was that I'm sorry.

461
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,370
Are we cool?

462
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,805
Yeah, we're cool. Thanks for stopping by.

463
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,362
Yeah, you should go quickly,
'cause we have work to do.

464
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,441
Okay.

465
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,246
What's this?

466
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,804
What is that?

467
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,405
"Let Blaine die"?

468
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,927
Oh!

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,606
Shit. We... We write in code. We write in code.

470
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,569
- This is compression...
-"Strengths.

471
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,644
"Blaine's last moment
is realizing face is gone"?

472
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,082
"Weaknesses. Blaine dies super fast."

473
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,084
Yeah, you really shouldn't be looking at that.
That's all proprietary.

474
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,401
"Opportunities, fuck Gina"?

475
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,207
Would you believe
that was here when we came in?

476
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,681
Double-A? Can I talk to you for a second?

477
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,330
Yeah. Leave me alone for a sec.

478
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,482
- What's up?
- Well, okay.

479
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,642
I just saw a version of the player window

480
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,611
that apparently you approved of
that says Powered by Homicide on it?

481
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,682
Oh, yeah, it does.

482
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,529
Right. Well, there's no Pied Piper logo.

483
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,285
Like, anywhere. So what's up with that?

484
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,805
Oh, well...

485
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,885
Homicide is an energy drink,

486
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,042
and "power" means energy.

487
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,805
So that's kind of confusing to the consumer,

488
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,090
so I think we're gonna keep it the way it is.

489
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,004
Uh, the whole point of doing this

490
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,811
was so that we could
get our name out there. Remember?

491
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,403
I tell you what. Let's see how it goes this time,

492
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,891
the next time we'll work something out.

493
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,726
No. No. We...
We can't see how it goes this time.

494
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,211
There is no next time. Okay?

495
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,726
We are racing to get
our platform ready for CES.

496
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,885
And we took time away from doing that
to do this so we could get PR value.
