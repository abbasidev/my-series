00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,370
Yes, hi. Um, would you just tell your boss

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,569
that the CEO of Pied Piper
is here to see them?

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,005
That's the company that they ripped off.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,407
Sure. And your name is, sir?

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,811
- Erlich Bachman.
- Uh...

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,531
No. I'm Richard Hendricks. I'm the CEO.

- Oh. Really?
- Yes.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,444
Why would you assume that he's the CEO?

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,807
Well, he's... No reason.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,209
Um, the guys are in a staff meeting
right now, though.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,327
They should be out shortly.

Would you guys
like some water while you wait?

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,046
We have four flavors,

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,327
and the cartons are made from
locally sourced, organic...

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,004
Yeah, we get it. You're funded, so...

The market has been
exceptionally volatile lately.

As a result,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,085
many of the very aggressive positions
we took at your specific request

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,242
have performed poorly.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,641
Very, very poorly.

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,686
Do you understand?

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,724
Yeah. Would you fuck her?

If I weren't married, I suppose.

But, Russ, as your business manager,

29

I need to tell you something,

I mean, even if it's just yelling at them,

00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,090
telling them that
they're not gonna get away with this.

Well, not if I have anything to do about it.

Oh, that's the company next door.

Uh... A couple of weeks back,
I went on a few interviews, okay?

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,931
And Yoyodyne was one of them.

Okay? I saw your "algorithm."

That's mine. You stole it.

77

Stole? We asked you guys
some questions a while back,

78
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,724

These, the photos. These are the photos.

81
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,768
This is proof that you stole it from us.

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,571
No, those photos prove that you gave it to us.

83
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,210
Well, you're stealing it all wrong.

There is something somewhere on this board

that is gonna strangle you at scale.

Don't write that down. Don't... Stop.

'Cause we have a finished platform
and you don't.

100
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,006
Which means we're the only middle-out

109
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,889
Question, what is failure?

110
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,524
To the ignorant
or those in conventional industries,

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,285
the recent Nucleus glitch may seem a failure

112
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,249
purely in the negative sense.

113
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,325
But we, in this valley,
all know that "failures," just like this one,

114
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,050
are really stepping stones.

115
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,367
To bring us the iPhone,
Steve Jobs first had to bring us...

116
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,126
The Newton.

117
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,284
To bring us Facebook,

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,081
Mark Zuckerberg also
had to bring us Wirehog.

119
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,446
Before he brought us Digg,

120
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,321
Kevin Rose had to bring us
a whole lot of useless things.

121
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,244
And after Digg as well, for that matter.

122
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,281
The point being,

123
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,768
what those in dying business
sectors call failure,

124
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,845
<i>we, "m tech, know to be 'are-greatness.</i>

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,640
Uh, I'm sorry.

126

results of your Nucleus live stream

127
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,047

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,168
No, I'm not telling you that.

129
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,965
History is telling you that.

130
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,088
Please, Gavin, enough spin.

131
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,806
A misstep of that magnitude,
there's no excuse.

132
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,450
It's not like we can tell the shareholders

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,443

134
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,645
Haven't I?

135
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,529
Have you?

136
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,204
We weren't told about this.

137
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,850
Well, if I told you about it,

138
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,129
it wouldn't exactly be a secret function.

139
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,281
Now, would it?

140
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,566
Secret function?

141
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,241
Are you saying you've added something new
to the Nucleus platform?

142
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,688
Imagine, if you will,
a function so game-changing

143
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,808
that its integration into Nucleus

144
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,282
will justify any miscue
in the platform's rollout.

145
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,842
Imagine, if you will,
a function so game-changing,

146
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,968
that its integration into Nucleus

147
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,011
will justify any miscue
in the platform's rollout.

148
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,081
Seriously, imagine it,

149
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,730
and do it quickly.

150
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,928
You were all brought here
to generate moonshots.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,650
I need a moonshot now.

152
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,926
If there's any greatness in any of you at all,

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,604
now is the time to access it.

154
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,444
Please don't disappoint me.

155
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,490

Holy shit. How?

But... Wait.
Didn't you start out with $1.2 billion?

175
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,967
I mean, you're not exactly broke, right?

176
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,405
I might as well be.

177
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,248
$986 million?

178
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,360
I'm not a billionaire anymore, Richard.

179
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,327
I'm a nine-hundred-and-eighty-sixionaire,

180
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,687
which isn't even a fucking thing.

181
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,524
I'm out of the Three Comma Club.

182
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,124
Functionally, I'm just like you.

183
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,850
Jesus, fuck, that's depressing.

184
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,210
Right. But you're still, basically, a billionaire.

185
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,361
Not if you round down.

186
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,920
If you round down, I have zero billion.

187
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,367
<i>Forbes</i> has taken me off their billionaire's list!

188
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,926
Instead, they'll probably put me on their
close-but-no-cigar list,

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,446
which is ironic because
I smoke a fuck ton of cigars.

190
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,249
Why the fuck do I buy so many cigars?

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,287
I remember the second I became a billionaire.

192
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,368
I was ass-naked, sitting right there,

193
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,566
just clicking and refreshing,
clicking and refreshing,

194
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,846
watching my stock rise.

195
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,685
And when it happened, I popped a rod so fast,

196
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,569
I went blind for a full minute.

197
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,130
Nutted all over those cushions.

198
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,648
I was the king.

199
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,245
Now look at me.

200
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,609
Two shitty fucking commas.

201
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,131
I had to sell my McLaren.

202
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,086
Yeah, but there's a Maserati in the driveway.

203
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,730
Who gives a fuck?

204
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,768
That has doors that open like this.

205
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,330
Not like this.

206
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,050
Or like this.

207
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,167
So it's all fucked.

208
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,049
Well, it's not all fucked.

209
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,567
You did save $50,000
not paying for the charity ball tickets

210
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,721
that you gave me.

211
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,770
Quite an embarrassing moment
for Jian Yang and I.

212
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,686
What? Richard, listen, my accountants tell me

213
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,287
I need you to start throwing off cash
as quickly as possible, okay?

214
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,489
But you said generating revenue
was exactly what we shouldn't be doing.

215
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,528
But now that I'm spelling billion with an

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,807
I'm saying do the exact opposite.

217
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,882
I need you to come back to me in 24 hours

218
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,088
and bring me a proposal
that turns the entire operation

219
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,764
into a sales-based model,

220
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,002
just like you told me
those assholes over at EndFrame have.

221
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,650
You're gonna dig me out of this hole, Richard.

222
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,210
- What?
- You said it yourself.

223
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,248
EndFrame is built to grab

Your mom is with her friend Philippe.

They're in Napa. She's gonna be a few hours.

These guys are gonna watch you, okay?

Watch out for the dog shit. Okay?

00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,760
I gotta hit the road. Daddy's going to Vegas.

Service Level Agreements

they take a huge number of man hours.

There's no way we could
find clients, negotiate terms,

and push deals out the funnel fast enough
to yield real cash anytime soon.

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,328
Okay, we were tricked, so...

347
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,122
Richie, you're not a guy
that should be worried about suing people.

348
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,524
You need to be worried about the guy
at Hooli who's suing you.

349
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,171
If you don't mount a vigorous legal defense,

350
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,210
then you lose to Gavin Belson by default.

351
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,762
And you are stamped "Property of Hooli."

352
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,162
You let Hanneman walk,
how do you plan on paying these cats?

353
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,163
I just paid them 80 grand.

354
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,004
As a retainer.

355
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,129
That retains them, now you gotta pay them.

356
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,764
Hold on. So I just paid them $80,000
for the right to pay them more?

357
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,841
Yeah.

358
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,605
Fucking lawyers, man, right?

359
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,923
Like it or not, Richie,
you're stuck with Hanneman.

360
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,409
<font color="#404040">MONICA:</font> I mean, technically,
it's not even a merger.

361
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,451
EndFrame just absorbs you, and you're gone.

362
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,764
Right. So, basically, we end up
working for EndFrame

363
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,162
after giving them our idea,
which was way better than theirs,

364
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,447
and they end up making more money than us.

365
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,522
Fuck that. Assholes.

366
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,927
Fucking king-sized assholes.

367
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,729
Butt-holes indeed.

368
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,121
What if we didn't do that?

369
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,409
What if, instead, we got
our own client like EndFrame has,

370
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,970
a porn company or something?

371
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,487
That's not really how it works, Gilfoyle.
You can't just go get a client.

372
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,722
- Why not?
-'Cause it's not that easy.

373
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,211
Why not?

374
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,681
'Cause EndFrame worked
that lntersite deal for months,

375
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,242
kicking every detail of the contract
and SLA back and forth,

376
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,288
promising tons of custom features.

377
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,408
And you can't just make that stuff up.

378
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,201
What if I didn't have to make it up?

379
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,729
What if I had every detail of their deal
on my computer right in front of me?

380
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,245
<font color="#404040">JARED:</font> I'm sorry, um...

381
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,531
Are you just asking what if...

382
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,768
Or do you actually have this information?

383
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,884
<font color="#404040">RICHARD:</font> Gilfoyle, please don't tell me

384
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,611
that you hacked into EndFrame's system.

385
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,571
Okay. I won't tell you that.

386
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,921
Well, did you hack into it or not?

387
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,128
My feeling is,

388
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,009
if you're the CEO of a company

389
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,646
and you're dumb enough
to leave your login info

390
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,324
on a Post-it note on your desk

391
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,247
while the people that you fucking ripped off
are physically in your office, it's not a hack.

392
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,846
It's barely social engineering.

393
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,809
It's more like natural selection.

394
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,804
Fucking ninja.

395
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,362
Okay, I was not in the room
while this was happening.

396
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,408
This is way over the line.

397
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,608
This is crazy illegal.

398
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,205
We're not trading on stolen information.

399
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,487
- It's not worth it.
- What if it was worth it?

400
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,005
It's not, so...

401
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,129
Gilfoyle, hypothetically,
how much is it worth?

402
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,170
$15 million.

403
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,406
- What?
- <font color="#404040">MONICA:</font> Holy shit!

404
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,324
Okay, I was definitely not in the room
while this happened.

405
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,721
I've got it all right here with a bow on it.

406
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,246
Delivery dates, benchmarks.

407
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,405
They're promising to deliver
high-quality 4K streaming video

408
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,084
at 20 megabits per second.

409
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,766
That's it? That's dog shit.

410
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,283
If we can put a half-decent build
of our platform in front of lntersite,

411
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,051
I mean, we can shark this 15 mil
right out from under EndFrame.

412
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,360
I... I don't understand.

413
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,920
How does lntersite
have all this money to throw around?

414
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,570
It's pornography, Richard.

415
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,087
Adult content has driven more important
tech adaption than anything.

416
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,084
I mean, the first fiction ever published
on a printing press

417
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,491
was an erotic tale.

418
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,403
And from there, it was Super 8 film,

419
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,006
Polaroid, home video,
digital, video on demand...

420
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,765
Credit card verification systems, Snapchat.

421
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,481
Pornography accounts for
37% of all Internet traffic.

422
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,641
38% when I'm on it.

423
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,122
Reducing lntersite server load
by a tiny fraction

424
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,282
could save them tens of millions
of dollars a year.

425
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,441
Hundreds.

426
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,764
$15 million is only like
six hours of lntersite CDN bill, right?

427
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,251
But to us, that...

428
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,642
I mean, we could settle out with Russ,
pay our legal fees,

429
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,121
have plenty of runway to get us to CES.

430
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,043
Minor detail. This is stealing.

431
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,805
You mean like lying and telling someone
that you want to fund their company,

432
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,450
and then taking their tech
when they meet with you?

433
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,648
Like that kind of stealing?

434
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,041
You wanted to do something, Richard.

435
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,770
This is something.

436
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,242
It's time to walk the left-hand path, Richard.

437
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,970
<font color="#404040">MOLLY:</font> The statistics here are clear.

438
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,089
Protecting existing revenue streams

439
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,322
is no longer a viable option.

440
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,244
We must run forward simply to stay in place,

441
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,245
by doing what the adult industry
has always done, lead.

442
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,488
Pioneering cutting-edge interfaces

443
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,281
across new device platforms
like Oculus and iWhack

444
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,681
will be the key to our survival as an industry.

445
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,730
And based on their recent
investment patterns,

446
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,531
tech leaders such as Facebook agree.

447
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,002

A fractal?

No, it's just pictures of art
I've been sending Karen

451
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,886
from my mobile phone,
which is charging over there.

452
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,407
I told her I just got back from
a gallery opening in Hunter's Point.

453
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,084
Who painted that disappointment?

454
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,090
Jaden, age five.

455
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,731
I got it from his Montessori school website.

456
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,723
He's not online, he's never gonna find out.

457
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,801
What?

458
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,405
Crimes against children...

459
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,482
- Really, so easy to get away with.

Oh, another text from Karen.

Fuck.

What's the issue?

465
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,846
This is what you want.

466
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,048
You know, it's...
The place is so dirty right now.

467

Probably another day
is best for such activity?

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,762
Should I tell her I'm out
getting Ethiopian tapas?

469
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,604
I don't see what the problem is here.

470
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,047
She wants to come over,
and she acknowledged that it's too soon.

471
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,088
You've basically done the deed,

472
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,650
which for you is

473
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,087
ejaculating in your own pants
all over your leg,

474
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,884
and then apologizing profusely.

475
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,322
Just maintain eye contact,

476
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,687
light some scented candles
and throw in some Sade.

477
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,649
The early stuff, though,

478
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,961
before her arrangements got too baroque.

479
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,327
Okay, that is sad.

480
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,971
But I can do this. Um...

481
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,691
She would never sleep with a guy
who lives like this.

482
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,325
I don't even know where to start.

483
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,767
Do you guys want to help me
clean up a little bit real quick?

484
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,524
No, don't do that.

I am data compression.

I do data compression,

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,490
and I know that, um, EndFrame is telling you

491

that they can lower your bandwidth
and storage costs

- I saw you at TechCrunch.

497
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,811
How do you know the specs
of my EndFrame deal?

498
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,840
I can't... I don't...

00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,922
Okay. I don't like this at all,

I'm sorry. Goodbye.

501
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,443
I can save you millions in bandwidth.

502
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,321
My... My algorithm is lossless.

503
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,327
I can deliver the same 4K video
at seven megabits per second, 60 fps.

504
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,683
We are faster and have
a higher quality than EndFrame

505
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,046
at a third of the bit rate.

506
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,929
- Bullshit.
- I can prove it.

507
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,842
Before you spend a dime, let me prove it.

508
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,330
You know I'm on the board of two charities

509
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,563
and a no-kill animal shelter
with Gavin Belson, right?

510
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,120
The man who is suing you for stealing his IP.

511
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,850
That lawsuit's bullshit.

512
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,964
I have a very complicated
deal in place with EndFrame.

513
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,202
Why should I back out and take a risk on you?

514
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,125
Back there, you said

515
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,171
that your business needs to do
whatever it takes in order to survive.

516
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,049
Well, so does mine.

517
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,405
And this is it.

518
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,882
If I don't get this deal, my company is dead.

519
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,401
So this is your place?

520
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,566
Yes.

521
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,007
I know it's weird
that a guy like me would live here,

522
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,005
but, honestly, this is just where I rest.

523
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,363
Out there is where I live.

524
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,408
Did you get my link
to the Catalan animation festival?

525
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,720
Oh, did I?

526
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,161
Where do you stand on
the subtitling v. dubbing debate?

527
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,765
'Cause to me, dubbing is boorish.

528
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,889
'Cause every language, to me, has its own...

529
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,724
Hey, how'd you get on our Wi-Fi?

530
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,723
How does your phone know the password?

531
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,086
Did it?

532
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,571
Yeah, it connected immediately.

533
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,608
- It's an alpha-numeric...
- Oh...

534
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,489
Long password.

535
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,650
Um... I...

536
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,327
Okay, this is really weird.

537
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,686
Karen?

538
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,321
Erlich. Hey.

539
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,288
I didn't realize that it was you, Karen,

540
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,886
the Karen that Dinesh...

541
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,684
You two know each other?

542
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,444
In a sense. Yeah.

543
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,481
- What...
- Outed by Wi-Fi.

544
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,131
...is the specifics of the "sense"?

545
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,841
Uh...

546
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,446
You never... You never called.

547
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,081
I got super busy.

548
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,527
Hey, we all do.

549
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,571
Well, we should probably
head to the festival, so...

550
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,129
So did you ever find my earrings?

551
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,890
ERLICHI I... I don't know.

552
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,366
Should we check the old lost and found?

553
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,487
<font color="#404040">KAREN:</font> Okay.

554
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,607
<font color="#404040">BIG HEAD:</font> So, here goes.

555
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:55,004
By wearing this standard
Hooli earbud headphone,

556
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,165
modified with a small piezoelectric sensor,

557
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,164
the user can control their Hooli phone

558
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,642
solely with their neural impulses.

559
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,167
Point, click, drag, even type,

560
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,130
all using only brainwaves.

561
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,411
Think it and it happens.

562
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,926
Holy shit.

563
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,646
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

564
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,210
This is great.

565
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,008
Fuck, yes, team!

566
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,287
So what's our timeline here?

567
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,203
I mean, when can we start testing this?

568
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,887
How long before we can
integrate this into Nucleus?

569
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,405
Not long.

570
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,051
It'll probably happen in our lifetime.

571
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,565
We just have to figure out
how to make it work.

572
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,450
But I really believe that our grandchildren

573
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,808
are going to grow up
taking this technology for granted.

574
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,406
Our grandchildren?

575
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,323
I know you're single, but you know,
you might meet someone.

576
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,323
No. No! No! What...

577
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,970
What do you have that's ready now?

578
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,326
Well, mmm...

579
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,722
Truth be told, we kind of put all
our eggs into this basket.

580
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,408
But we do have
the kick-ass potato cannon, though.

581
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,880
Although, actually, this one is... ls broken.

582
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,844
We tried to put a Mr. Potato Head in it,

583
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,366
and it did not like that.

585
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,764
Still in there, eh?

586
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,605
What do you think?
Will they ever find those earrings?

587
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,002
Funny thing about lost items,

588
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,686
always in the last place you look.

589
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,084
Thanks for coming in, guys.

590
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,128
I look forward to working with you.

591
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,529
Us, too.

592
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,443
Come on back. This way.

593
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,604
We're right in here.

595
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,370
Good to see you again.

596

What is this?

597
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,361
This is a bake-off.

598
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,202
I'm gonna give EndFrame and Pied Piper
the same video library to compress.

599
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,406
In a week, I'll review

600
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,608
and award the contract
to whoever does a better job.

601
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,806
What?

602
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,644
- Um, whomever.
- What?

603
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,482
Whomever does the better...
But okay, yeah. Never mind.

604
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,086
Welcome to the left-hand path, my friend.
