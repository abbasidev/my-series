1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,849
Thanks for coming in
and sitting down with us.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,766
We're really excited to meet a few
good engineers to join the Pied Piper team.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,605
So, why don't you tell us
a little about yourself?

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,722
I don't work before noon.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,809
Or after 2:00 p.m.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,248
And I need to bring my dog to work.
Are you dog-friendly?

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,044
Oh, yeah, you can bring your dog to work.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,964
That's not what I asked.
Are you dog-friendly?

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,241
Um...

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,369
Nice pool. Can my dog go in?

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,727
Yeah, yeah, we're very dog-friendly.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,565
Is there a lifeguard?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,047
Um...

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,565
'Cause my dog can't swim.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,807
Now, it says here on your résumé that
from 2010 to 2011, you "crushed it"?

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,887
That's actually an old résumé.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,204
It should also read
that I crushed it from 2013 to present.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,841
So, are we to understand
that you did not "crush it" in 2012?

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,720
There was a medical situation preventing me
from crushing it to my usual standards.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,203
So, I had to take some time off
until I was able to crush it at 100%,

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,409
at which point I resumed crushing it full-time.

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,043
So, it says here that you're proficient in C++,

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,011
code assembly
for multiple processor architectures,

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,447
and that you are a cyborg?

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,763
That is correct. Short for cybernetic organism.

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,207
I came into this world of filth and pain
with a congenital heart condition,

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,525
requiring the installation of a pacemaker,
upon which I am mortally dependent.

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,401
<font color="#404040">RICHARD:</font> Mmm.

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,930
Wow. He's technically a cyborg.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,004
Yeah, yeah. Makes the résumé accurate.

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,281
Look, we all know
that I can make a shitload more money

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,684
working for some multi-colored Happy Town
in a hermetically-sealed box.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,970
But permission to be honest?

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,881
Permission granted.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,201
Granted.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,285
I like that you guys are so weird.

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,561
Hmm.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,887
Yes, we are the weird ones.

The blue one is for recycling.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,206
Go ahead and put those in there.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,520
Yeah.

47
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,450
Very good.
The black one is for all other trash.

48

Do you understand?

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,771
Yes. Which is for burning?

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,928
No, we don't burn trash in this country.
It's illegal.

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,770
You never burn trash.

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,288
Okay, can you say that? "I never burn trash."

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,284
- I never burn trash.
- Yes.

54

is definitely on some end of some spectrum,

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,926
but he is a full-stack engineer.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,809
I mean, I'm sold. Jared, what do you think?

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,924
Well, he's qualified
and he definitely seemed interested.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,570
It's a programmer's market right now.

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,484
I think if we like him,
we should pursue him aggressively.

66
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,884
My only concern here, and it's a small one,
urn, he's also named Jared.

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,201
Will it be confusing with two Jareds?

68
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,926
If we hire him,
I can always go back to my real name, Donald.

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,725
No, that's too big a hassle.
We'll just go with Other Jared.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,086
OJ, for short.

71
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,241
I know a name is just a sound
somebody makes when they need you,

72
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,767
but shouldn't this much-newer Jared
be Other Jared?

73
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,841
You should be flattered.

74
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,009
O.J. Simpson is one of the most
recognizable people on the face of the planet.

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,609
Was that Jared Patakian
I saw exiting the house?

76
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,490
Yes, we just interviewed him.
We think he's great.

77
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,928
He actually is great.
I tried to hire him for Aviato.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,571
But then he took the offer,
shopped it around town,

79
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,244
and got more dough at a different gig.

80
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,049
I didn't care for the way that he handled it.

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,648
So, I am going to have to err
on the side of caution and say, "Pass-adena,"

82
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,881
Trina.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,689
Well, I'm sorry that that happened to you,
but you don't get to Pass-adena on anyone.

84
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,923
We've got to hire a lot of people,
and he was the only one that we all agree on.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,129
But this is my house.
I'm on the board of this company.

86
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,771

You are being promoted.

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,926
Being named co-head dreamer
carries with it a significant pay increase,

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,810
greater equity,
more favorable vesting schedule.

121
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,924
See, but I really like the job I had.

122
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,568
You know, I was perfectly happy there.

123
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,647
It was kind of the perfect level
of involvement for me, I think.

124
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,768
And also, that other guy, Bannerchek,
he did not really seem to like me very much.

125
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,288
Oh, he does not. And he wanted you to know

126
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,930
that he moved four school-aged children
and his elderly mother across the country

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,210
in order to run Hooli XYZ on his own.

128
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,329
He was very clear about that.

129
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,200
And he wanted me to convey that to you.

130
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,961
Have I done that?

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,526
Yeah. So, what is my job exactly?

132
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,288
Well, that's actually... That's up to you.
You can do whatever you want.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,526
Okay. See, that's sort of
what I do now, though.

134
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,965

in a much more significant way.

Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone
you guys recommended I contact,

145
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,887
Carla Walton?

146
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,884
Yeah, we hung out with her a bunch
at the last SF vid/tech meet-up.

147
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,610
Her code is fucking great.

148
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,251
She was head of engineering at EarCast?

149
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,245
She was engineering at EarCast.
She built that whole system on her own.

150
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,651
You know what else excites me here?

151
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,645
There's a distinct over-representation of men
in this company. Look around.

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,527
I think it would behoove us
to prioritize hiring a woman.

153
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,567
I disagree, OJ.

154
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,644
We should hire
the best person for the job, period.

155
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,960
And Carla is one of the best.

156
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,451
Right, let me rephrase.

157
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,841
I think having a woman in the company
is important,

158
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,605
but hiring someone
only because they're a woman is bad.

159
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,126
I would never compromise Pied Piper.

160
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,725
Okay, just to be clear,

161
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,322
our top priority is to hire
the most qualified person available, right?

162
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,606
Of course.

163
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,803
But it would be better
if that someone was a woman

164
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,929
even though the "woman" part
of that statement is irrelevant?

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,085
Exactly. It's like we're the Beatles
and now we just need Yoko.

166
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,925
That's the worst example
you could have used.

167
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,406
I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using
WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via P2P.

168
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,723
So, basically,
I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream

169
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,484
and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.

170
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,242
The users pay for all that bandwidth,
not you? Wow.

171
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,091
That could save us a ton of money.

172
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,685
Yeah, a shit ton.

173
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,527
And do you think you could integrate it
into our platform by January in time for CES?

174
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,931
Look, I'm not going to get in your way.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,651
You know, you design the engine.
I just assemble the car.

176
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,724
I could have an alpha of that up
in a solid weekend of hacking.

177
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,564
Wow. Cool.

178
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,648
Plus, I could count on one hand
the number of people on Earth

179
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,122
who could handle sitting in a room
with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day. So...

180
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,401
All of that.

181
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,931
Plus, you're a woman.

182
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,721
What?

183
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,121
No, I just mean we would absolutely love
to have a strong woman working here.

184
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm not a woman "engineer." I'm an engineer.

185
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,408
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Okay, no, no.

186
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,209
Oh, no, yes, of course.

187
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,363
We want to hire the best people
who happen to be women,

188
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,124
regardless of whether or not they are women.

189
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,770
That part is irrelevant.

190
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,921
Are you doing that interviewing thing

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,207
where you try to rattle somebody
to see if they freak out or not?

192
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,809
Uh, sadly no. This is... That's just Jared.

193
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,609
I wouldn't know how to do that.

194
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,609
Well, I am aggressively
unemployed right now.

195
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,405
So, why don't you give me a call
when you know what you want to do?

196
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,447
- Great.
- All right.

197
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,642
Great. All right, I'll show you out.

198
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,927

It's a wide spoon. In fact, the only spoon type

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,810
I specifically posted a note
on the refrigerator saying

210

that the more narrow spoons be reserved
for the eating for FAGE yogurt by me.

Aren't you supposed
to just tip that little plastic cup part up

214
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,245
and dump the jam into the yogurt?

215
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,131
How would you know that?
Have you been eating my FAGE yogurts?

216
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,850
No, I saw it on the billboards.

217
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,366
Well, what they don't tell
you on the billboards

218
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,169
is that you can't get all of it out.

219
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,647
Look at that! You have to dig it out.

220
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,442
But you can't dig it out with these big-as-hell,
wide fucking spoons.

221
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,921
This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich?

222
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,883
This is about Jared Patakian.

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,766
This is about me not letting you tell me
who I can or can't hire.

224
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,726
Or maybe it's about the fact that you're
the one who's been using my narrow spoons?

225
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,887

can't come out.

so fucking stupid.

331
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,126
Yeah.

332
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,089
She doesn't even know
what I'm saying right now.

333
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,768
And until we get real office space,
I guess we could just put you right here.

334
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,649
And we could put Patakian here.

335
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,927
I hope you don't mind
sitting next to a cyborg.

336
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,764
Does he fart a lot and smell like onions?

337
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,126
Well, he is a coder.

338
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,886
Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough
to deal with this crap, but I so am, so...

339
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,930
You know, if it's cool, I'm going
to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.

340
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,368
I know I don't start till Monday, but I want
to get it cleaned out before I trade it in.

341
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,521
You're getting a new car?

342
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,171
Yeah, yeah. Mercedes HYBRID.

343
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,362
- It's pretty dope.
- That sounds expensive.

344
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,726
- Guys?
-It is.

345
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,446
Richard has something
very important to tell you.

<font color="#404040">RICHARD:</font> Yes. <font color="#DF01D7">(CLEARS THROAT)</font>

347
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,845
So, Jared has informed me that as CEO,

348
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,843
I need to be able
to answer any questions that you might have

349
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,641
about Pied Piper's harassment policy
and workplace code of conduct.

350
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,883
Apparently, every company our size
has to have one of those.

351
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,407
So, essentially,
if you find the workplace hostile in any way,

352
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,404
you can submit a written complaint.
It will be completely anonymous.

353
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,643
Essentially, don't do or say anything
that might offend anyone.

354
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,882
Okay? Thank you. That's the policy.

355
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,803
- Okay.
- Guys, um,

356
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,689
this is actually pretty serious.

357
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,570
I mean, we're all cool here,
but we know each other.

358
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,326
So, obviously,
when Dinesh calls me Retarded Frankenstein,

359
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,562
or he describes me as AIDS Lady,

360
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,564
or Gilfoyle refers to me
as effeminate k.d. lang,

361
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,921
I know this is a joke among friends.

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,764
-It's not a joke.
- We're not friends.

363
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,842
<font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLING)</font> See, it's hilarious.

364
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,925
But, um, as we grow,

365
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,243
we're going to be adding a lot of new people
to this company and to this office,

366
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,450
and some of them might not be
as amused as I am by such strong language.

367
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,091
Lawsuits happen. So, questions?

368
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,682
- Oh, uh, I have a question.
- <font color="#404040">JARED:</font> Mmm-hmm.

369
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,762
My best friend's nickname is Cunty.

370
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,127
- I'm sorry, her name is...
- Cunty.

371
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,362
And I was hoping I could call her Cunty
while I'm here.

372
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,442
Okay, that one's easy. No, you cannot.

373
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,921
'Cause, you know,
I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch,

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,968
and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty,"

375
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,089
then it's like, I'm not going
to want to have Cunty over at all,

376
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,921
which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,968
Yeah. Um, it does not...

378
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,041
As a woman.

379
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,123
Okay, I'm going to have
to get back to you on that one.

380
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,645
Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.

381
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,085
- Okay.
- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen

382
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,481
-so we can...
- Okay, okay, okay.

383
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,123
All right, I'm going to go
clean out my shit box.

384
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,087
Nice bag.

385
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,281
Thank you.

386
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,761
Oh, look, D&G. It's like
Dinesh & Gilfoyle. So, yeah.

387
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,326
Okay, that was the third reference
she's made to how much money she's making.

388
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,401
GILFOYLEI Mmm.

<font color="#DF01D7">(KEYBOARD CLACKING)</font>

390
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,324
That's a $3,500 bag.

391
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,971
How do you know? You have the same one?

392
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,441
No, I have the fucking Internet.

393
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,727
Hey, you don't think she's making
more money than us, do you?

394
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,201
No, we all have equalized pay, remember?

395
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,171
Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do,
but not new hires.

396
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,130
It's the classic dilemma
where the founders make less.

397
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,726
We told Richard to get her
no matter what it took.

398
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,531
Even if she is making more cash than us,
which she isn't,

399
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,364
there's no way she has as much equity.

400
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,125
You don't know that.
And Richard won't tell us. It's confidential.

401
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,440
I guess there's a reason for it.

402
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,602
It's so people don't get jealous
and throw a hissy fit.

403
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,651
I'm not jealous. I just want to make sure
she's making less than me.

404
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,882
Hey, how do we find out
how much she's getting paid here?

405
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,406
I have a plan.

406
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,047
Hey, Carla,
how much money do you make here?

407
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,127
Uh, Let's just say
it's a big jump from my old job.

408
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,841
Right, but you probably
got more equity there.

409
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,563
Um, no, actually I get more equity here.

410
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,687
What?

411
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,683
Yeah. Why, what are you guys getting?

412
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,205
Three points each.

413
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,325
Three? That's weird.
I thought you got in at the beginning.

414
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,249

No, these are already paid for.
We're guests of Russ Hanneman.

425
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,847
Uh, yes, he reserved the tickets,
but you have to pay for them.

426
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,810
Oh. Uh...

427
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,086
Okay. And how much are they?

428

$25,000.

429

Um... So... But for both?

430
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,446
No, no, no, per ticket.

431
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,730
There's no possible way that
we could pay that, so what do we do here?

432
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,724
Well, there are a number of other ways
to help preserve the Muir Woods.

433
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,723
We do a volunteer clean-up program
every weekend.

434
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,370
Yeah, I don't give a shit
about the Muir Woods.

435
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,283
I need to get in there.

436
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,409
Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets,
I really don't see how that's possible.

437
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,960
What if we do, like, a little in-and-out thing?

438
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,682
I just go in there, 10 minutes,
you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.

- Yes, I'm hungry.

Gentlemen, I'm going to need you
to move aside for the other guests.

441
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,887
You want me to email
Russ Hanneman right now?

442
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,610
You don't have Russ's email.

443
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,483
But I have his... I have the phone number
of the person who works in his office.

444
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,289
Does anybody have an extra ticket?
My investor cannot pay.

445
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,331
That's actually not true. Uh...
I think they must have misplaced the tickets.

No, we have everyone's tickets here.

All right. Let's go, Jian.

Hey, Jian Yang. How was last night?

457
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,569
It was sad.

458
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,610
Erlich, he promised me dinner
with a big meet.

459
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,841
Big meat?

460
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,241
- Big meet people.
- Meat people?

461
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,923
Then people say, "No, you can't come in."

462
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,771
Wait, so you guys didn't get in?

463
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,207
We went to Taco Bell.

464

Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.

465
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,527
He tried to blame the taco sauce.

For what?

472
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,405
Um...

473
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,244

And which two of the several

Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity,
so I can't tell you that.

how much you make.

- Are you fucking with them?
- Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.

482
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,211
I bought a fake Dolce & Gabbana bag
at a swap meet to piss them off

483
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,281
and apparently it did.

484
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,524
And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.

485
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,446
I also left a fake credit-card statement open
on my screen, because I thought they'd see it.

486
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,567
- Did they see it?
- They saw it.

487
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,801
- Yeah, sweet.
- Okay.

488
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,087
- Carla.
- Okay, all right.

489
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,482
But what I used to do to fuck with them
involved gay porn and Photoshop,

490
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:48,088
so I don't think that would be cool
after OJ's big harassment speech.

491
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,211
Oh. So, in effect, the policy worked.

492
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,409
Well, I... Can we not do any of it?

493
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,723
It just that they're getting really pissed
and it's really distracting.

494
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,611
All right.

495
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,283
- No more Cunty.
- Terrific.

496
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,964
- That's really good.
- Cunty's done.

497
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,726
Great. But you said it again,
but maybe that's the last time.

498
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,809
Cunty's done. I'm gonna call you OJ, though.

499
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,006
- Yeah, that's fine.
- That's for good.

500
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,525
Yeah, yeah, because in my head,

501
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,122
I change the meaning from "Other Jared"
to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.

502
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,321
<font color="#404040">ERLICH:</font> If I have to, I'm going to keep
my fucking Star Blazer VHS tapes in my room!

It doesn't take an IQ-9
to know they should remain alphabetized.

504
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,602
I want to watch a specific episode.
And it's not like they're on fucking DVD!

<font color="#DF01D7">(SIGHS)</font>

506
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,487
Hey, um, Erlich,
I just want to say this is your house

507
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,166
and you've been really cool
letting us stay here for all this time,

508
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,925
and as soon as we get our office space,
we'll be out of your way.

509
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,127
And how soon is that going to be?

510
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,926
Soon.

511
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,841
And look, I realize it's not fair
that I bring someone into your house

512
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,126
that you don't want here,

513
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,522
so I will call the cyborg
and I will rescind the offer.

514
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,969
You know, Richard, I've been thinking,
the cyborg is a solid coder.

515
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,246
You should hire him.

516
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,004
It's fine, I'll get someone else.

517
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,451
Don't be stupid, Richard.

518
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,729
You need a full working beta up
in the next few months. Just hire the guy.

519
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,122
I'm not being stupid, okay?
I'm not going to hire him.

520
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,885
And frankly, I'm not going to let you
bully me into doing it.

521
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,201
Would you look at yourself?
You're still not fucking listening to me.

522
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,203
No, I'm trying to respect you, asshole.

523
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,726
If you want to respect me,
then just hire the piece of shit.

524
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,801
Don't act like a moron.

525
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,089
You're not going to kick Nucleus's ass
acting like a fucking moron.

526
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,640
You don't get to tell me
how I respect you, okay?

527
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,564
I can respect you however the fuck I want.

528
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,207
What are you doing?

529
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,009
I'm respecting you.

Jared, hey, it's, uh,
Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.

532
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,050
Yeah, bad news. We're not gonna...

533
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,081
What?

534
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,925
What's that?

535
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,721
Where?

536
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,880
Okay.

537
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,602
Well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin'...

538
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,445
- Metal-dick piece of shit.
- Metal-dick piece of shit.

539
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,521
Ha-ha-ha.

540
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,601
What happened?

541
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,243
He took another job

542
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,284
from Russ fucking Hanneman.

543
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,885
- What?
- Yeah.

544
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,407
Apparently, I said so much
nice shit about him in the board meeting,

545
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,371
Russ offered him a job at one of his other
fucking companies for a lot more money.

546
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,488
Our own investor poached him.

547
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,042
And he went? Fucking cyborg.

549
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,328
What event could this possibly be used at?

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,565
Are you happy?

551
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,486
Not really.

552
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,483
They used the old logo.

553
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,087
Do you smell something burning?

554
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,889
God damn it! Jian Yang!
