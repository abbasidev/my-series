1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,804
How can Gavin Belson claim
that he owns Pied Piper?

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,962
I mean, this whole lawsuit is insane, right?

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,123
Well, let me ask you something, Richie.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,641
And I need you to be totally straight with me.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,691
Was Pied Piper related in any way

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,127
to what you were doing
when you were working at Hooli?

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,691
No. No, not at all.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,331
I was doing quality assurance
for mobile messaging.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,289
It had nothing to do with compression.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,647
They didn't even have a
compression division at that time.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,684
And did you work on Pied Piper on Hooli time

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,411
or use Hooli equipment
to develop it in any way

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,324
-at any time, Richie?
- No, and no.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,241
Great. And by the way,

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,403
always tell me that. And tell yourself that.

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,643
Because if you believe it, a jury will, too.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,648
I do believe it. It's the truth.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,003
Great. That one was even better
than the other one.

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,845
I love it. Always say it exactly like that.

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,727
Yeah, okay. Look, um...

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,801
<font color="#DF01D7">(SIGHS)</font>

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,969
We're going to win this, right?

23
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,771
Richie, if what you just told me is the truth,

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,441
and don't tell me if you lied,

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,010
Gavin's got nothing here.

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,447
This is a classic intimidation lawsuit

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,241
designed to freeze you until
after Nucleus comes to market.

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,324
It's got all the usual boilerplate nonsense.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,324
"Breach of contract," "unjust enrichment,"

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,851
"breach of non-solicitation,"

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,605
and the hiring of someone
named Donald Dunn.

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,921
Jared. We call him Jared.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,970
Changing his name to get out of it,
clever but irrelevant,

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,249
because all we care about are
the intellectual property claims.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,687
And we will win this.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,209
- Good.
- But we're going to have to lawyer up.

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,001
What do you mean? Aren't you our lawyer?

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,731
I'm not a litigator. That's what you need.

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,771
Another lawyer? Really?

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,565
Lawyers, Richie.
You don't want to mess around here.

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,962
A young start-up with an IP lawsuit
hanging over its head?

42
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,045
<font color="#DF01D7">(LAUGHS)</font> I wouldn't want
to be a part of that team.

43
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,647
Well, but you are a part of that team.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,963
I'm part of the team that team is on.

45
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,764
Yeah. It just sounds really expensive.

46
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,401
Says the guy who just got
bukkaked with fat term sheets.

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,329
Welcome to the business, Richie.

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,007
Look, wherever we're at with your funding,
legal fees will be worked into the deal.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,481
You've got Raviga. You're covered.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,081
Relax.

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,010
"We're out"? What do you mean, "We're out"?

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,608
Was it not clear from the context?

53
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,010
We, at Raviga, are out of the business
of funding Pied Piper,

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,845
at least while the Hooli lawsuit
remains unresolved.

55
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,002
That suit is total nonsense.

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,811
Nonsense is not
a quantifiable metric, Monica.

57
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,325
Risk is.

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,324
Funding any early-stage company
is a high-risk proposition,

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,641
but compound that uncertainty
with a legal cloud

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,291
over the company's intellectual property,
and it's untenable.

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,847
And that is just the financial risk.
There is also a legal risk.

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,002
We could become embroiled in
Gavin Belson's lawsuit

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,366
for aiding and abetting.

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,922
And there is a political risk for the firm,

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,082
but especially for me as its new leader.

66
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,721
I'm being heavily scrutinized
from both within and without.

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,851
I cannot have my first decision post-Peter
be one with such dubious fundamentals.

68
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,570
It's a rudimentary decision.

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,604
How am I supposed to tell them this?

70
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,849
In my experience, it's best
to look a person in the eye

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,288
and deliver the information
with warmth and compassion.

72
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,041
Okay.

73
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,970
One other suggestion.

74
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,883
Dress unattractively when you tell them.

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,043
I read a study.
The less sexual interest they feel for you,

76
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,010
the less perturbing it will be.
It sounds strange,

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,445
but it's credible.

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,889
May I suggest the beige ensemble

79
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,486
in which you came to work... Tuesday?

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
Things are just really different at Raviga,

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,927
and I had nothing to do with the decision.

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,801
Guys, I'm so, so sorry.

83
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,169
Wait, so the company that offered us the most

84
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,766
until Richard talked them
into offering us the least

85
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,205
is now offering us nothing?

86
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,204
But the fact that you're so sorry
makes it all better.

87
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,647
You guys will be fine.
You'll find someone else.

88
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,247
We don't want someone else, Monica.
The whole point of going with you guys

89
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,209
was because we trust you guys.

90
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,761
- Trusted.
- We still have our 5% stake,

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,763
and Laurie said that
I can still sit on the board,

92
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,649
which means I can still come to meetings...

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,006
Can I say something here?

94
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,925
First off, Monica, you're not fooling
any of us for even a second

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,765
with your dress-shitty-to-ease-the-pain
routine.

96
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,569
It's a classic chick break-up move,

97
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,530
and you're not very good at it, either.
You look great.

98
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,247
Yeah, beige is a good color for you.

99
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,685
You're a true autumn.

100
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,763
Secondly, who cares?

101
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,084
We have a three-foot stack of term sheets
from the top VCs on the face of the planet.

102
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,409
So the top one fell out. As Jay Z says,

103
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,811
"On to the next one."

104
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,729
Jared, who's our next best offer?

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,844
Between the numbers and the reputation,

106
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,570
that would be Coleman Blair Partners.

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,490
I'm gonna go put my face on.

108
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,962
Call Coleman Blair. Tell them that
Santa Claus is coming early this year,

109
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,249
and he's bringing a big bag of Pied Piper.

110
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Well, I'm going to leave this room
without saying goodbye to you.

111
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,207
I'm sure you can find your way out
with one of your two faces.

112
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,844
Sorry about that.

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,207
The guys are just a little emotional.

114
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,408
No, I get it.

115
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,688
And look, I probably shouldn't say this,

116
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,048
but there are a lot of really great VCs in town.

117
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,400
You'll be fine. I just...

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,411
Just what?

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,410
Just tell them that you're really excited
to be in business with them

120
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,767
and try to close quickly.

121
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,763
You know, while momentum
is still on your side.

122
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,602
<font color="#DF01D7">(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)</font>

123
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,048
Well, it's gonna break a lot of hearts
on Sand Hill Road

124
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,088
but congratulations.

125
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,611
We decided to go with you.

126
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,203
Uh, we were told that
you were going with Raviga.

127
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,085
And I am happy to say
that is no longer the case.

128
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,640
We're really excited to be
in business with you guys.

129
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,530
Can I ask... Did you walk away from them,

130
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,161
or did they walk away from you
because of the lawsuit?

131
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,963
Ah, that lawsuit we know to be frivolous.

132
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,606
Yeah.

133
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,965
Is that a Yes Folder?

134
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,891
No.

135
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,402
So, no pastries today, huh?

136
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,405
So both Raviga
and Coleman Blair Partners passed

137
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,450
-because of the lawsuit?
- Frivolous suit. It's nothing.

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,807
Well, it's not nothing.

139
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,202
Look, before we start negging each other...

140
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,285
- Negging?
-It's a term used in sexual manipulation.

141
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,447
Maybe not relevant here.

142
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,046
We're really excited to be
in business with you guys.

143
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,121
Hmm...

144
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,442
We actually see this lawsuit as a positive.

145
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,605
We will win, and it proves
that we have something worth suing over.

146
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,651
And yet Raviga, Coleman Blair Partners

147
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,963
and Wood Opal Fund have all passed.

148
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,531
We're really excited to be
in business with you guys.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,001
Hmm...

150
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,963
You know term sheets aren't
legally binding documents, right?

151
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,486
Of course not. They're just guidelines

152
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,045
that people follow

153
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,001
unless, of course, they're pussies.

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,363
You came in here three days ago.

155
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,489
You were arrogant,
condescending and offensive.

156
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,642
Now you come in here, you call me a pussy...

157
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,485
Whoa! I did not call you a pussy.

158
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,647
I said that people who break
term sheet agreements are pussies,

159
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,088
and that hasn't happened... Yet.

160
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,042
Thus, I haven't called you a pussy... Yet.

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,571
You're in control of the situation.

162
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,645
Hooli has the unlimited resources
to hamstring you

163
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,082
until Nucleus comes out, at which point,
they will be the market standard,

164
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,401
and you will be irrelevant.

165
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,689
We're here to invest in innovation,

166
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,161
not lawyers,

167
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,641
so let me be perfectly honest with you.

168
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,844
Your behavior

169
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,400
was boorish and juvenile...

170
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,563
You were rude, vulgar and uncouth.

171
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,843
You were coarse, graceless and puerile.

172
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,367
Obscene, insulting and ignorant.

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,566
Ignorant?

174
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,361
You called me a shit-riddled, anal wasteland.

175
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,922
You called me a chode-gargling fuck-toilet.

176
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,408
We're really excited to be
in business with you guys.

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,207
Uh, guys, I hate to panic you

178
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,282
until I'm absolutely sure it's warranted,

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,126
but Richard just texted me.
We got our seventh pass.

180
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,722
- Fuck.
- Fuckin' Gavin Belson.

181
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,325
All the VCs turned on us.

182
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,206
Apparently, Erlich used some
pretty assertive vaginal metaphors last round,

183
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,368
so it's been a bit of an uphill climb.

184
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,841
I think we're going have to crunch
our burn-rate again.

185
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,288
Even with the $50,000 from TechCrunch,
we're not going to last very long.

186
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,521
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.

187
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,570
Richard said we were going
to split that money, right?

188
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,687
$10,000 each?

189
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,366
I don't think we can afford to do that anymore.

190
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,521
Fuck!

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,447
I just donated $5,000 to my cousin
Wajeed's Kickstarter campaign.

192
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,404
He's trying to get an app
called Bro off the ground.

193
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,481
Bro?

194
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,682
It's a messaging app that
let's you send the word "bro"

195
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,091
to everyone else who has the app.

196
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,003
So it's exactly like the Yo app.

197
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,321
Yes, but less original.

198
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,010
Why don't you just cancel your credit card?

199
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,401
That way Kickstarter can't collect your pledge.

200
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,847
<font color="#404040">DINESH:</font> Well, I would love to,
but he looks up to me.

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,685
I was always like the cool cousin
of the family, you know what I mean?

202
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,250
Wait.

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,490
Did you just say you were "the cool cousin"?

204
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,761
Yeah.

205
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,486
Please explain.

206
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,211
Well, when we were kids,
I was the one getting good grades,

207
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,851
I was the one who was planning for my future,

208
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,730
I would bring gifts for my teachers
'cause they worked so hard.

209
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,361
You know, cool stuff.
He was always getting in trouble,

210
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,649
he got caught smoking opium
in the tool shed,

211
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,643
he crashed my uncle's motorbike.

212
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,404
And you think you're the cool one?

213
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,045
Yeah, it's different in Pakistan.

214
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,407
I've never been, but I know it isn't.

215
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,087
Oh, here it is. Bro 2 Bro is a 1-bit
communication messenger,

216
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,964
"The fastest way to speak your mind."

217
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,247
As long as what's on your mind
is the word "bro."

218
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,961
Well, he's still shy of his goal.

219
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,566
If he doesn't get there,
none of the pledges get collected.

220
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,609
I feel horrible for what I'm about to say,

221
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,170
but I really hope he fails.

222
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,688
That is the first cool thing you've ever said.

Richard and Erlich are heading
into their last stop.

226
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,285
I trust Erlich can be diplomatic and pull it off.

227
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,043
A few days ago, I came in here
and I did some things

228
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,010
and said some things that I should not have.

229
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,971
Also, we would like to open about
the fact that Pied Piper

230
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,850
is involved in a complicated legal matter

231
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,605
that could affect our potential value.

232
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,602
And that being said, we are open

233
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,763
to renegotiating the funding terms
to reflect that.

234
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,367
But most of all, I want to thank you.

235
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,251

Mr. Bachman, I didn't have you come
all the way back here today

240
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,529
just to apologize to me.

241
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,484
Please, it's Erlich. And you didn't?

242
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,129
Of course not. I asked you back

243
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,171
because three days ago I sat right here,

244
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,369
and I watched you put
your testes on this reclaimed

and you're going watch me do the
same goddamn thing to you.

- My turn.

- Bro?

254

Bro? Like, it lets you send the word "bro"
to anyone else that has the app.

255
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,250
I know what it is.
You've explained it to me so many times.

I love it, but you know, I'm not saying...

258
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,409

"Oh, he couldn't get funding,
so he had to go to Kickstarter

260

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,444

Yeah, like with what happened
to your app. Yeah.

What do you mean,
what happened to my app?

277
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,602
Everybody started talking about how bad
it was, and then you ended up giving up.

278
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,331
I didn't give up.
I left to go work on Pied Piper.

279

So you're saying, then,
that if Pied Piper didn't happen,

Guys, something interesting just happened.

315
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,725
So, I downloaded Wajeed's
Bro app out of curiosity

316
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,450
and found it very sticky.

317
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,682
I've never felt like I was anyone's bro before.

318
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,491
The only people who have used that term
with me were assailants,

319
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,803
but I started bro-ing people
and getting bro'ed back.

320
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
This is my nightmare.

321
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,926
And all of a sudden,
I'm bros with all kinds of people,

322
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,162
including a guy from Branscomb Ventures.

323
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,164
Branscomb? That's a solid shop.

324
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,851
Yes. So we bro'ed about this and that,

325
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,605
and then when he heard
I worked at Pied Piper,

326
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,048
he got excited, he triple liked my bro,
and he asked about meeting us.

327
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,811
Okay, but does he know about the lawsuit?

328
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
Yeah, I told him.
I mean, you know what they say,

329
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,762
-"Bros disclose."
- No one says that.

330
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,605
Wait, doesn't Branscomb already
have its own compression play?

331
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,125
Yeah, but not a good one, apparently.

332
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,323
I mean, they want to sit down with all of us,
engineers included.

333
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,206
That only happens
in a second or third meeting.

334
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,203

335
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,284
Okay, Jared, what did you tell him?

336
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,091
Um, I was waiting a bit to bro him back,

337
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,571
so that I don't seem over-eager.

338
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,880
Bro him back! Bro him back.

339
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,206
Bro him.

340
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,004
We're not dead yet, guys.

341
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,447
Well, get some sleep, my bros.

342
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,887
I'll set the meeting, and, um,

343
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,930
then I'll go find some hoes
to prioritize behind you.

344
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,882
Are you trying to say, "Bros before hoes"?

345
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,527
It's sexist, but it's about friendship.

346
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,325
Middle-out is based on a completely
new probabilistic model.

347
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,289
It finds long range structures that's hidden

348
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,250
even to domain-optimized algorithms.

349
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,091
I'm sorry, is this too in the weeds?

350
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,288
Not at all. Take us into the weeds.

351
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,807
Wouldn't you rather hear
our go-to-market strategy?

352
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,769
You mentioned something earlier about

353
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,481
stacking Middle-out on top of
another compression algorithm.

354
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,846
How does that even work?

355
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,129
I mean, you can't compress something that's
already compressed to entropy.

356
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,167
Right?

357
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,810
WOW. Uh...

358
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,486
I don't really get too many of
those questions in meetings like these.

359
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,809
But it's actually easier if I show you.

360
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,848
- May I?
- Absolutely.

361
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,730
Okay, great. Here I go.

362
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,849
Stacking Middle-out is actually very real.

363
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,526
- Let's take...
- Do you have to pee, Jared?

364
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,728
Because I have to pee.

365
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,928
I would love to pee.

366
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,164
<font color="#404040">RICHARD:</font> There.
When you stack Middle-out...

367
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,967

- They definitely are.

368
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,122

What are you doing?

371
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,208
I told you I didn't have to go pee.
What is happening?

372
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,487
Those guys are never going to fund us.
We need to leave now.

373
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,568
What are you talking about?
This is going great.

374
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,211
I mean, VCs are never interested
in how Middle-out actually works.

375
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,203
Of course they're interested,
because they want to steal it.

376
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,805
This is a classic brain-rape.

377
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,008
- What?
- We did it at Hooli all the time.

378
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,050
We'd schedule meetings with companies
so they'd explain their technology,

379
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,043
then we'd use their ideas in our products.

380
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,242
- Like what happened to Yelp.
- Yes.

381
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,322
It's like when somebody says
they want to go birding with you,

382
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,368
but really they just want to
get you alone in the woods,

383
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,680
so they can take your binoculars.

384
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,321
Look, those guys aren't doing
technical due diligence.

385
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,131
They're not even consultants.
They're a compression company.

386
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,328
One of them has braces, for fuck's sake.

387
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,209
- Braces!
- Shit.

388
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,770
Dinesh and Gilfoyle, they're still in there.

389
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,969
Middle-out doesn't restrict itself to
H-264's two-dimensional grid

390
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,849
or time-bound patterns at all.

391
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,127
This is great. Great.

392
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,041

to these things and I think I know why.

I mean, why would anybody
donate to something like Bro

414
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,565
and not a homeless shelter or schools?

but he's throwing away
half the world's market.

422
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,568
You know what "bro" means in Mandarin?

423
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,369
It means "asshole."

424
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,729
You know what "bro" means
in Portuguese? "Rapist."

425
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,651
In Latvian, it roughly translates to

426
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,087
"one who beheads the messiah."

427
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,882
In Finnish, "bro" means "a baby's erection."

428
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,008
In Urdu, "bro" is actually short for
"brokhta ver, "

429
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,289
which means "a dildo for a man."

430
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,771
A man's dildo.

431
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,965
"Fecal eclipse."

432
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,724
it loses something in translation.

433
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,689
We don't have a word for it. They do.

434
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,171
It's "bro."

- Oh, shit.

500
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,522
Okay, I actually have another call, so...

501
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,931
I'll get out of your pubes.

502
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,044
I'm emailing you intros to the
guys you're meeting tomorrow.

503
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,281
Later.

504
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,761
Hello?

505
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,281
Oh. Uh, hello.

506
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,847
Yes.

507
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,001
Uh-huh.

508
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,447
Sure, just me?

509
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,450
Okay, what time?

510
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,121
Hello.

511
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,682
Richard. Thanks for coming.

514
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,801
What are we doing, Richard?

515
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,605
Lawsuits and lawyers?

516
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,606
You out there getting rejected
by every VC in town?

517
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,091
Neither of us want this,

518
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,970
but maybe together we can find a way out.

519
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,403
Yeah, easy. Drop the lawsuit.

520
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,484
- You know I can't do that.
- I didn't steal Pied Piper from you,

521
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,561
and you know it.

522
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,081
Well, that's up to the courts to decide.

523
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,650
And until they do, you're frozen.

524
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,446
Meanwhile, my best engineers
are working around the clock

525
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,801
to get me a Middle-out algorithm
that surpasses yours.

526
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,611
And in January when we have it
and we come to market,

527
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,523
you won'tjust be frozen, you'll be dead.

528
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,968
You played your best hand,
Richard, and you lost.

529
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,527
It's just business. So...

530
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,651
Wouldn't you rather get something
out of Pied Piper while you still can?

531
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,562
- Let me acquire you.
- What? No way. Are you kidding me?

532
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,130
We should have just done this the first time.

533
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,771
I know you thought about it.
It's the perfect fit.

534
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,161
You get my infrastructure, I get your speed,

535
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,130
and I get it today rather
than in a month or two.

536
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,361
What's the downside?

537
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,169
The downside is that everything I'm building

538
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,891
becomes the property of your giant
soulless corporation.

539
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,522
And what exactly
do you think you're building?

540
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,644
You're out there trying to get funding
so you can hire people,

541
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,961
scale up, roll out a product, IPO,

542
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,169
and eventually become
a publicly-traded what?

543
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,206
Corporation.

544
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,446
We would be different.

545
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,683
I see. I suppose once Pied Piper
is a billion-dollar company,

546
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,889
you'll seek out your competitors
and help them.

547
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,925
Please. Let's face it.

548
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,130
What is Hooli if not the best possible
future version of Pied Piper?

549
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,123
You think you're building
something different? No.

550
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,170
You're building something that's exactly
the same as what I've already built,

551
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,642
except with you instead of me.
But that's not possible now, Richard.

552
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,766
But you know what is? We could build
something together, you and me.

553
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,003
Something great.
Something the world needs now.

554
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,930
Look, I don't have to do this.

555
