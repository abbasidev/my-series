Well, well, look who's the big shot.

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,364
Yeah, big shot.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,489
How are you guys?
Everything good over at Nucleus?

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,530
Nucleus is dog shit. How do you do it, man?

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,810
You used to be the most useless guy
in the entire Nucleus team,

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,322
but now you run an entire division.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,845
Did you ever ask yourself why?

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,083
No. <font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLES)</font> No, I never have.

13

- Fucking Big Head.

Oh.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,571
Hey. Hey, you forgot your phone.

00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,449
At least, I think this is your...

- This is Nucleus?
- Yep.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,924
That is a beta of their entire mobile platform,

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,321
and it sucks.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,802
Yeah. I mean, the UX is, like, Soviet-era.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,884
When it stores photos,
they actually get larger.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,405
They never cracked middle-out.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,170
I actually kind of wish
you didn't show me this,

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,722
because now
I know we totally would have beaten them.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,441
As it is now, I mean, we can't get funded.

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,124
All of our new coders quit.

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,129
I mean,
can you even imagine what would happen

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,050
if, like, a tech blog
got their hands on that piece of shit?

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,560
They'd tear it apart.

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,008
I mean, it could actually
totally destroy Nucleus' release.

38
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,290
I bet Gavin would do, shit, anything
to prevent that from happening, right?

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,805
Yeah, totally.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,970
Jesus, Richard,
am I actually ahead of you on this?

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,569
Take the phone, man.

42
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,963
- It's yours. Take it.
- Are you serious?

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,249
Yeah, dude. Come on, I owe you.

44
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,485
I mean,
I was about to quit Hooli and move home.

45
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,646
And then
Gavin promoted me just to spite you.

46
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,122
And now, he keeps promoting me
for some inexplicable reason.

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,283
I mean, I haven't done anything, Richard.
I mean, less than nothing.

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,046
- Well, yeah.
- But look at me now.

49
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,962
We're sitting on my boat, Richard,
and that's because of you.

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,362
Soon, we can sail it to fucking Hawaii

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,085
or Sausalito.

52
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,083
Three more classes,
and I get my boat license.

53
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,845
Really? How many classes does it take?

54
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,207
Three. It's three classes.

that would mean
that no tech bloggers or journalists did,

If my phone

93
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,810
Palo Alto Chief of Police, Ed Gaskins,

94
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,884
who, apropos of nothing, happens
to be a close personal friend of mine,

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,685
would have to go and ask this person
where they got my phone.

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,362
<i>Keep in mind,
these aren't real journalists, Richard.</i>

97
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,885
<i>They're tech journalists.</i>

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,210
Do you think they'd go to prison
to protect their source?

99

<i>I don't either.</i>

100
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,801
And since this phone's OS
is a stolen prototype

101
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,603
worth $40 to $60 million,
you're looking at felony grand theft, Richard.

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,202
<i>You could go to jail for 40 years.</i>

103
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,884
<i>Then again, you'd probably be fine
in a full-blown hard time penitentiary.</i>

104

Binding arbitration? What's that?

117
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,525
Well, it's like a trial,
but massively accelerated.

118
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,604
Next week,
we're gonna go in front of a retired judge

119
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,763

and then we're done.

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,162
So, this will all be resolved next week?

121
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,891
I've always wanted to go
to binding arbitration.

122
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,247
A weird thing to have always wanted to do.

123
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,405
Everybody who's ever sued me
has settled out of court. Pussies.

124
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,891
But now, finally, I'll be able to take the stand,
be a part of the big show.

125
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,965
No show.
This is a serious legal proceeding, okay?

126
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,010
And speaking to that,
Ron LaFlamme has got us a new litigator

127
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,889
and we are meeting him in an hour.

128
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,247
How are we gonna pay this person?

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,008
Our guy has agreed to waive his entire fee
until our case is resolved.

130
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,566
It's some wet-behind-the-ears noob
straight out of law school.

131
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,645
No, he is said to be very experienced,
one of the best in the biz.

132
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,889
Then why the fuck
would he take our case on spec?

133
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,926
Was I in possession of
cocaine, amphetamines,

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,049
amyl nitrate, also known as "poppers,"
at the time of my arrest?

135
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,884
In large quantities.

136
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,931
Did I have consensual intercourse
with two women under the age of 18?

137
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,531
Repeatedly. I admit this.

138
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,525
Did I violate the Mann Act and transport them
across state lines for sexual purposes?

139
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,167
Alleged, but not proven.

140
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,081
And, boy, they tried. They tried.

141
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,731
Therefore, I was incarcerated
and I was disbarred.

142
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,770
Wait, hold on. You were disbarred?

143
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,410
So, you can't practice law?

144
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,043
Not in open court in the State of California.
That's correct.

145
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,690
But this is an arbitration.

146
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,284
I'm really grateful for the opportunity.

147
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,891
I'm turning my life around.

148
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,366
I've served my time.

149
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,725
Questions?

150
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,810
I guess I have one at least.
What does amyl nitrate do?

151
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,928
- Oh, it dilates the anus.
- That is accurate.

152
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,725
Also produces euphoria.

153
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,207
- Okay, thank you, Pete and Jared.
- Sure.

154
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,126
Anal dilation aside,
what do you think of our case?

155
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,647
You think we're gonna go in there
and just dick-slap those Hooli pieces of shit?

156
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,364
I have reviewed your case
and it is extremely strong.

157
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,766
Thank God.

158
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,207
I do, every day of my life.

159
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,369
It's only by his grace that I was able

160
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,327
to survive that plunge into the ravine
and 11 months in a state penitentiary.

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,167
I'm sorry, were you in an emotional ravine
or did you actually go into a ravine?

162
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,281
Both.

163
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,245
Now, with your approval,
I would like to move forward.

164
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,126
I currently am not in possession of an office,

165
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,168
and I'm residing in a halfway house,

166
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,449
so I would like to give Hooli Legal
your home address.

167
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,527

168
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,365
They need to send over
their discovery documents,

169
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,561
all of them.

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,684
All of them?

171
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,163
This is craziness.

172
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,049
Couldn't they have just emailed all this?

173
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,851
I mean,
it's mostlyjust printed-out emails, anyway.

174
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,610
Yeah, of course, they could have.

175
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,480
And it would have been digitally searchable,
and that is the point.

176
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,801
It's a classic document dump.

177
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,202
But what they didn't take into account
is the power of us.

178
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,805
So, grab a box, guys.
Start pulling anything you think is relevant.

179
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,485
And you may have to work pretty hard,
but it will free us from this lawsuit.

180
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,409
- Are you saying, "Work will set you free"?
- Yes.

181
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,561
They have the manpower.

182
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,041
We have the perseverance.
Triumph of the will.

183
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,328
He's the most cheerful person
I've ever heard quote Hitler.

184
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,441
So, Hooli's entire intellectual property claim
boils down to three simple questions.

185
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,126
Did your work on Pied Piper
at any time overlap

186
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,885
with your scope of work or Hooli business?

187
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,086
Uh, no.

188
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,288
Did you ever do work on Pied Piper
on Hooli time?

189
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,361
No.

190
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,011
And at no time
did you ever use Hooli equipment

191
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,809
to develop Pied Piper in any way?

192
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,166
No, never.

193
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,001
We're on our way, then. You just tell that
honestly to the court, and we're home free.

194
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,361
Okay.

195
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,968
Unless, of course, you've offered
a conflicting version of that to anyone,

196
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,125
a friend, your parents, girlfriend.

197
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,684
No, no, and not possible.
I haven't had a girlfriend in, like, three years.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,161
Boyfriend?

199
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,801
No. I'm not gay, just busy.

200
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,123
- We're not litigating your sexuality.
- That's good, yeah.

201
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,249
It's a good thing, too, because if we were,
we'd all end up in prison.

202
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,526
Am I right?

203
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,120
No offense.

204
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,202
Here, I did a first pass.
Let me know what you think.

205
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,963
Just a few questions for you to ask me
while I'm on the stand.

206
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,929
It's rough clay. We can shape it as we go.

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,844
You realize I have no intention of
ever putting you on the stand?

208
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,691
What? Why not?

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,321
Well, I just don't think
you have anything to offer the case.

210
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,285
They're trying to say
that Pied Piper was created at Hooli,

211
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,802
whereas I'm living proof
that it was created here in my incubator.

212
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,247
I nurtured Richard like a little baby.

213
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,890
I was his patron,
like the Borgias with Da Vinci.

214
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,841
Actually, the Medici were Da Vinci's patrons.
The Borgias poisoned people.

215
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,809
- Say "Medici" again.
- Medici.

216
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,723
- Shut the fuck up.
- That's how you pronounce it.

217
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,169
Let's be clear, okay? The burden of proof
falls on Hooli here. And they have none.

218
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,210
You have a Barrett 50-caliber rifle
at your disposal

219
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,090
that you can use to shoot Gavin Belson
in the goddamn face.

220
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,246
And you're not gonna use it?
What kind of fucking attorney are you?

221
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,725
Well, technically,
I can't refer to myself as an attorney

222
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,486
until I'm reinstated
and make restitution to my victims' families.

223
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,243
I'm a lawyer. And I'm a good one.

224
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,121
And if you know one end
of a Barrett 50-cal from the other,

225
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,486
I'll eat a bowl of shit.

226
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,410
Did you get a taste
for that on the inside? Mmm?

227
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,601
Hey, guys,

228
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,169
it's been almost two weeks
since the mother condor has been to the nest.

229
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,242
Do you think
something might be wrong with the egg?

230
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,171
Something is. It's on our website.

231
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,408
No, really. I mean...

232
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,841
I think maybe I should call the museum,
see if this is normal.

233
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,002
Jared, you want that egg to be alive, right?

234
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,241
- Of course.
- Well, right now,

235
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,046
because you don't know whether it is or not,
it exists in both states,

236
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,485
like Schrédingefls cat.

237
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,881
Like what?

238
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,724
It's a quantum mechanics thought experiment

239
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,566
that an Austrian physicist came up with
to help understand quantum states.

240
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,964
So, he imagined putting a cat into a box
with poisoned food.

241
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,327
There's a 50/50 chance the cat eats it.

242
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,050
That does sound rather Austrian.

243
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,246
<font color="#404040">DINESH:</font> So, according to Schrédinger,

244
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,563
if you open the box
and confirm that the cat is dead,

245
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,291
then in a sense, you've killed the cat.

246
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,170
Or if you call the museum
and get the information,

247
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,045
then you've killed the egg.

248
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,608
- No, that's silly.

You and I are going into arbitration tomorrow.

I need you to look me right in the eye
and tell me why you've been lying to me.

I haven't been lying to you.

258

You told me
you haven't had a girlfriend for three years.

259
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,489
I have found at least 15 emails
to Nelson Bighetti

260
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,291
in the last year
where you reference a girlfriend.

261
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
"Spent the day in bed with my girlfriend."

262
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,444
"A homeless guy in the coffee shop
almost stole my girlfriend."

263
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,007
It's a joke. Big Head and I,

264
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,765
we call my laptop my girlfriend

265
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,643
because it's the only warm thing
that's touched my crotch in a little while.

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,249
So, when you said, quote,

267
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,086
"My girlfriend shit the bed last night,"
that was your laptop?

268
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,400
Laptop, yeah.

269
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,688
Well, that's good to hear.

Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

271
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,248
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Now, listen to this.

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,963
April 10th, 11 :14 p.m.,
"Taking my girlfriend to the Apple store."

April 12th, 3:42 p.m.,
"Picking my girlfriend up at the mall."

274
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,801
Yeah, so?

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,924
So, your laptop was in the shop
for three days, right?

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,445
The 10th through the 12th, right?

277
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,801
Yeah, and?

278
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,963
April 11th, 2:48 p.m.,

- What's it?
- God damn it.

294
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,851
Well, under the law,
Hooli can lay claim to the underlying

295
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,321
intellectual property
that makes up Pied Piper.

296
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,131
So, we're fucked now, is that it?
We're totally fucked?

297
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,682
Well, I mean, it all depends on
whether or not the attorneys at Hooli

298
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,809
figure out that your girlfriend is your laptop.

299
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,769
Are you telling us this entire case

300
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,531
hinges on people believing
that Richard had a girlfriend?

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,889
to all the numerous counts
brought by Mr. Belson,

307

of intellectual property.

310
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,330
my client is willing to concede
that Donald Dunn was improperly hired.

311
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,571
And on the unjust enrichment charge,

312
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,929
Richard will agree to repay Hooli

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,447
$39 and 99 cents

314

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,761
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess that is right.

334
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,087
It seems like everything you touch
is made dramatically better, Mr. Bighetti.

335
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,324
You make a meaningful
and crucial contribution

336
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,928
to everything you do, do you not?

337
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,050
Wait. I'm sorry. Do I not?

338
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,845
Are you asking if I do do that
or if I don't do that?

339
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,641
This is amazing. They have nothing.
It's a desperate play.

340
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,131
They're trying to build him up,

341
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,407
make it seem like
he was a crucial part of Pied Piper.

342
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,570
It's a Hail Mary. They have nothing.

343
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,565
Because if I don't not do that,

344
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,085
isn't that the same as...

345
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,242
- Let's move on.
- Okay.

346
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,607
Is it not true that Wired...

347
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,929
I'll rephrase.

348
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,528
Did <i>Wired</i> magazine run a cover story on you?
Yes or no?

349
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,405
Oh, yes.

350
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,847
That did happen, yes.

351
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,211
<font color="#404040">JARED:</font> I think I just made a mistake.

352
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,606
That was the museum.

353
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,680
I decided to call and check on the condor,

354
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,322
and they said that it's very unlikely
that the condor egg is still alive.

355
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,369
But my phone call itself

356
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,969
drew their attention
to the low viewing numbers

357
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,566
and they've decided
to take down the cameras today.

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,402
So, by making the phone call,
you've most likely killed the condor egg.

359
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,326
Oh, come on, I mean,
that Schrédinger stuff's all just theoretical.

360
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,209
- It doesn't apply here.
- <font color="#404040">DINESH:</font> Doesn't it?

361
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,600
I mean, look at Richard.

362
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,684
He didn't know
that he had tested on a Hooli computer

363
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,889
until Monahan
opened that box of emails, right?

364
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,042
So, Richard was both innocent and guilty,

365
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,571
but as soon as Monahan opened that box,
it made Richard guilty.

366
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,284
But, I mean, by that logic,

367
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,409
anyone who goes to an open-casket funeral
is a murderer.

368
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,563
You are one dark motherfucker, Jared.

369
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,961
<font color="#404040">WOMAN:</font> So, Mr. Bighetti, you have stated

370
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,649
that you didn't have
anything to do with Pied Piper.

371
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,326
No.

372
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,122
I suppose you'd also say that you had
nothing to do with Hooli XYZ either.

373
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,641
No, not really.

374
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,166
And what about
the Hooli AIDS and Cancer Societies,

375
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,528
of which you were president?
Did you have anything to do with those?

376
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,004
Honestly, not really. I actually remember
when they told me I got the AIDS thing,

377
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,562
forjust a second
I thought they were telling me that I had AIDS.

378
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,208
But then I realized, no,
I was just the president of the AIDS thingy.

379
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,568
- But for a second, it was pretty scary there.

380
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,083
You see, Your Honor, Nelson Bighetti
is pathologically modest.

381
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,002
While he humbly denies credit,
the record shows

382
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,765
that he had everything
to do with all of these achievements.

383
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,683
It may be possible
that Nelson actually believes

384
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,366
he didn't have that much
to do with the founding of Pied Piper either.

385
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,407
'Cause...

386
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,610
But it is painfully obvious
that he had a huge hand in it.

387
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,442
No further questions, Your Honor.

388
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,609
<font color="#404040">JUDGE:</font> May I say, Mr. Bighetti,

389
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,763
how refreshing it is to finally
encounter someone in the tech community

390
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,889
who is so free of pretension and ego?

391
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,569
<font color="#404040">PETE:</font> Well, that was troubling.

392
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,926
<font color="#404040">ERLICH:</font> Yeah, what was that?

393
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,128
It's just that
he scored big points with the judge in there.

394
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,165
So, what's our plan? Do we go in there
and cross the shit out of him?

395
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,641
Tear him a new hole in his butt?

396
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,324
Let's just remind ourselves here

397
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,727
that he gave me the phone
and made this whole thing possible.

398
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,325
So, let's take it easy on him.

399
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,767
Yeah, I don't think shredding him
is the right way to go either.

400
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,764
- Thank you.
-It could backfire, turn the judge against us.

401
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,645
I have something else in mind.

402
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,651
Mr. Bachman,
are you still prepared to testify?

403
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,611
Fuck yes, I am.

404
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,771
- Mr. Bachman.
- Yes, sir?

405
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,923
You are the owner and sole proprietor

406
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,401
of the Palo Alto-based Hacker Hostel

407
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,690
in which Mr. Hendricks
and Mr. Bighetti both resided. Is that correct?

408
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,327
Yes, sir. That is, in fact, correct.

409
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,165
Uh, it has been called
the "Garden of Tech Eden."

410
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,328
Is it also fair to say
that every instinct you have as a businessman

411
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,448
has been completely and totally wrong?

412
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,409
- Sorry, what?
- You hard of hearing, Mr. Bachman?

413
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,086
- No, I've heard everything...
- Aren't you considered a joke in this town?

414
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,761
I don't quite know
where you're going with this.

415
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,129
Nor do I. Can you tell us
where you're headed here, Mr. Monahan?

416
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,645
Your Honor, if you are to accept

417
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,441
Hooli's reverence for Mr. Bighetti
as proof that he's a genius,

418
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,965
then you must also accept

419
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,443
Mr. Bachman's reverence for Mr. Bighetti
as proof that he's a moron.

420
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,648
I'm simply establishing this type of logic,
Your Honor, cuts both ways.

421
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,489
I see. I'll allow it.

422
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,289
Really? Because I don't think "joke" is...

423
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,129
Mr. Bachman, you have incubated

424
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,047
a seemingly endless string
of patently unsuccessful apps, haven't you?

425
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,442
No. No, that is not correct.

426
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,650
I incubated Pied Piper. I saw the value in that.

427
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,645
Oh, did you? Isn't it true
that you were about to evict Mr. Hendricks

428
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,802
until he became the subject of a bidding war?

429
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,487
You disliked Pied Piper.

430
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,844
The one app in your hostel
that showed promise.

431
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,650
Well, I think that's a bit harsh. I mean, every...

432
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,922
In fact, you tried to encourage Mr. Hendricks

433
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,449
to change his app to be more like
Mr. Bighetti's horrendous app

434
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,562
called NipAlert. Isn't that true?

435
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,201
Well, yes,
I thought NipAlert showed great promise. Yes.

436
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,850
It did not show great promise.

437
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,324
What it showed was the location
of nearby women possessing erect nipples.

438
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,569
And as such,
Mr. Bighetti's grotesque creation

439
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,601
was passed over by every investor
in this town except you

440
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,045
because it was perverted.

441
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,444
Well, I'll admit that...
I'll concede that the cultural moment

442
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,124
may have passed, but at the time...

443
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,488
No, at the time,
it was as misogynistic as it is now,

444
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,971
wasn't it, Mr. Bachman?

445
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,207
- It... Yes, it had some major problems...
- Some major problems?

446
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,842
Mr. Bachman, a few moments ago,
you said that it showed great promise.

447
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,448
You said that. I can have the court reporter
read it back to you, Mr. Bachman.

448
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,369
I don't need her to read it back to me.
I can remember...

449
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,724
NipAlert was poorly conceived
and riddled with bugs, wasn't it?

450
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,370
Well, all apps in the beginning...

451
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,887
Mr. Bachman, answer the question.
You liked NipAlert, and it was terrible.

452
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,325
- No, I...
- Didn't you?

453
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,244
- Liking an app...
- Mr. Bachman, you liked it, didn't you?

454
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,130
Okay, yes, yes! Fine! Yes, I liked it.

455
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,646
Even though it was a terrible app
and it had no market potential.

456
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,961
I was high when he pitched it
and I like nipples...

<font color="#404040">PETE:</font> Thank you, Mr. Bachman.

that Richard tried to boot it up on his system,

461
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,564
it crashed his laptop.
It was in the shop for three days.

I mean, among other things that weren't that

466
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,090
were reasons why it was bad.

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,446
No more questions, Your Honor.

468
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,246

They're calling you next, Richard.

They want you on the stand in 10 minutes.

Great. So, they figured it out.
We're fucked, aren't we?

It looks that way.

475
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,365
Damn it, they're gonna
ask me if I ran a test of Pied Piper

476
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,727
on a Hooli computer,
and I'm gonna have to say yes.

What if you said no?

What are you talking about?

479

because you don't seem to know shit.

Richard, all they know

485
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,246
is that you didn't have your laptop
when you ran that test,

486
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,322
so just tell them that you borrowed my laptop

487
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,801
or you came home for lunch
and used my computer.

488
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,003
Whatever you say, I'll get back on the stand
and then back you up.

489
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,641
That would be committing perjury.
That would be lying under oath.

00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,606
90% of what could potentially be
a billion dollars...

494
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,728
I mean, you know, because I have 10%.

495
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,768
I know. God damn it, I know.

496
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,286
Richard, do the right thing here.

497
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,282
Lie on the stand.

498
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,249
Mr. Hendricks, you are heterosexual, yes?

499
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,050
Uh... Yes.

500
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,487
How long has it been
since you were in a relationship

501
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,528
with a woman, Mr. Hendricks?

502
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,728
Two years? Three?

503
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,082
Yeah, that sounds about right, I guess.

504
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,765
You're under oath.

505
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,930

506

Longen

507
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,611
So, you've definitely had no girlfriend
in the past three years?

508
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,923
This seems needlessly cruel. We all get it.

509
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,041
Mr. Hendricks, when you refer to a girlfriend
in these emails to Mr. Bighetti,

510
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,804
to what are you referring?

511
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,561
MY laptop computer.

512
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,246
The same laptop
that Mr. Bachman just told us

513
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,210
was in the shop for three days

514
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,489
from April 10th to the 12th of last year?

515
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,327
Yes. Can we get to the point, please?

516
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,563
Mr. Hendricks, did you at any time

517
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,124
use a Hooli computer to test and/or alter
your Pied Piper algorithm?

518
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,201
<font color="#DF01D7">(SMACKS LIPS)</font>

519
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,123
You're under oath.

520
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,001
I just...

521
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,406
I just wanted to be different.
I wanted Pied Piper to be different.

522
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,088
But if this company is built on lies,

523
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,289
then we're really
not much different than Hooli.

524
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,728
The law says that I lose everything,

525
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,201
my whole company,
everything that I worked for,

526
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,410
because I used one Hooli computer <font color="#DF01D7">(SIGHS)</font>

527
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,289
to test and modify one block.

528
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,804
Is that right? I mean, is that fair?

529
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,847
To me, if the system says that's fair,

530
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,641
then I guess
I'm probably not meant to be a part of it.

531
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,200
Mr. Hendricks, please answer the question.

532
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,370
Did you at any time use a Hooli computer...

533
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,922
Yes. Yeah, I did. I made a mistake and I did.

534
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,128
I used a Hooli computer
to work on my algorithm, one time.

535
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,443
And so, here you go.

536
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,406
It's okay, Richard.
You don't have to protect me anymore.

537
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,403
I'm his girlfriend.

538
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,363
Sit down, Mr. Bachman.

539
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,726
Judge, objection!

540
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,645
I was the one
that was in the shop for those three days

541
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,200
'cause he had hit it so hard,
I needed a doctor.

heard from Richard?

544
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,404
Should I text him
to see how the arbitration's going?

545
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,209
Uh... You can.

546
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,921
But right now, it's going both well and poorly.

547
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,083
And if you get
definitive information back and it's bad,

548
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,767
I could argue that you have
effectively caused us to lose the arbitration.

549
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,249

I'm not gonna read it.
