Like, who's watching a blank screen?

328
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,410
We never went down, gents.

He says delete it.

336
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,571
- What?
- He says,

337
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,127
"We just lost. It's my company.
Delete it all. Now."

<font color="#DF01D7">(SOFTLY)</font> Motherfucker.

339
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,370
Now, Pied Piper, you conceded
on all of these minor counts.

340
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,411
Accordingly, on the count
of wrongful solicitation,

341
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,883
I find Richard Hendricks did indeed
breach his contract with Hooli

342
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,329
when he hired away a Hooli employee,
one Donald Dunn,

343
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,644
AKA Jared, AKA O.J., apparently.

344
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,610
But this is where things get interesting.

345
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,606
Mr. Belson, there is language in this contract

346
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,207
that the California Supreme Court
has deemed unlawful.

347
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,684
Preventing Mr. Dunn
from seeking employment elsewhere

348
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,843
is a violation of his rights.

349
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,490
Are you aware of this?

350
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,009
I was not, but I'm willing
to drop that count altogether

351
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,241
if it makes things easier.

352
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,643
Well, here's the thing.

353
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,042
This clause was unlawful

354
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,648
when you included it
in Mr. Hendricks' employment agreement.

355
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,530
Right. As I said,
I'm willing to just move past this.

356
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,001
See, again, I don't think you understand.

357
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,163
If Mr. Hendricks hadn't hired Mr. Dunn,

358
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,847
or you hadn't pursued him for that hire,

359
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,685
I'm not sure I would've noticed the violation.

360
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,280
But you did, so I did.

361
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,681
<font color="#DF01D7">(SOFTLY)</font> What's happening?

362
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,125
Justice, baby.

363
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,282
And what I find is,

364
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,170
this is an unenforceable contract.

365
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,969
It is null and void.

366
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,524
So, effectively, Mr. Hendricks never had
a valid employment agreement with Hooli.

367
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,767
As a result, Hooli has no claim
to ownership of Pied Piper's underlying IP.

368
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,888
That is my ruling.

369
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,961
And per your arbitration agreement,
it is binding and final.

370
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,804
Thank you, everyone.

371
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,049
What the fuck just happened? We lost?
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

372
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,044
We won. We won, right?
I mean, Pied Piper is ours?

373
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,167
Richard, not long ago,

374
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,891
emergency workers
pulled me out of the flaming wreckage

375
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,962
-of my Mercury Grand Marquis.
- All right.

376
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,570
Today, you pulled me out of
the flaming wreckage of my life,

377
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,290
and those flames burn far hotter.

378
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,646
- Sure.
- For that, I thank you.

379
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,721
Yeah, you're welcome.

380
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,326
I used to take a tampon,
soak it in grain alcohol,

381
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,323
and stick it up into my rectum.

382
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,765
That got me high, Richard,

383
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,650
but not half as high
as the drug you just gave me.

384
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,085
You know what that drug's called?

385
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,961
No.

386
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,366
A second chance.

387
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,568
Right on. Uh...

388
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,210
Well, thank you. You did great.

390
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,290
Wow! I mean, I totally thought
we were gonna lose that.

391
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,169
I actually told the guys to...

392

Oh, my God.

393
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,804
All right, I just wrote a mod of DBAN.

394
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,726
As soon as we run it,
it will delete the entire code repository.

395
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,690

Did you hear he just lost the Pied Piper suit?

That's nothing. They're saying
half of all Hooli employment agreements

I am rarely wrong about these things.

You have an aura about you.

513

An aura that if carefully managed by someone
with the necessary spiritual expertise,

514
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,481
could be harnessed to great effect.

515

your boss lady gave me a call.

if you want to go for a drive some time.

528
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,361
Got my own.

529

Does it go like this?

530
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,083
Does it go like this? No?

531
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,045

533
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,689
I just ran into Russ Hanneman leaving.

534
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,730
He said you made him some
kind of, uh, a deal.

535
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,926
Yes.

536
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,482
He was substantially difficult,
truly repugnant.

537
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,690
And when we finalized our agreement,
he described his erection to me.

538
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,480
But in the end,

539
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,962
I managed to buy
100% of his interest in Pied Piper.

540
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,923
Let us never speak of him again.

541
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,203
<font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLES)</font> Well, that is fine by me,

542
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,082
and I'm so glad that
you got him away from Pied Piper.

543
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,329
I mean, now that their suit has been resolved,

544
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,768
I think that they're about to become
something really special.

545
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,170
Their core technology, it's visionary.

546
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,241
Absolutely.

547
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,166
Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles

548
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,242
with Homicide, with lntersite,

549
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,521
with the very decision to pursue video
instead of more pioneering applications,

550
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,410
this was all rooted in human error,

551
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,485
which is why I found it prudent
to secure Hanneman's shares,

552
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,043
his voting rights, and, most critically,
his board seats.

553
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,847
Right. Russ has two board seats.

554
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,246
He did.

555
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,088
Now, Hendricks votes one,

556
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,522
Bachman votes one,

557
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,251
and we, at Raviga,

558
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,810
we vote three.

559
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,165
That is a majority.

560
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,644
We can now take the necessary steps

561
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,246
to ensure that Pied Piper
is properly managed.
