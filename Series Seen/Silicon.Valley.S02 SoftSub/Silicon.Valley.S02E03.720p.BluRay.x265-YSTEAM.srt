<font color="#404040">RICHARD:</font> This is a good buyout.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,248
It's way better than what Gavin offered before.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,449
And our packages include
nice salaries, cash earn-outs,

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,729
stock in Hooli, which vests after
only four years of working there.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,848
I mean, this seems
like a pretty good deal, right?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,322
Hooli?
You really think we'd go work for Hooli?

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,090
What the fuck is wrong with you, Richard?

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,810
What other options do we have?

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,047
We need serious funding
to go up against Nucleus,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,531
and we don't have that.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,126
- So, listen...
- I will listen

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,328
to the sound of you chortling on my balls.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,563
- Okay.
- Richard, I'm an independent businessman.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,008
Emphasis on "independent" and "business."

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,491
And "man," come to think of it.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,971
Count me out.

17
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,202
Actually, you're not
being offered employment at Hooli.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,645
They'd give you a full buyout.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,766
How big?

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,525
Okay, maybe I'm not explaining this right.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,683
I mean, when you heard
Gavin Belson say it, it sounds much clearer.

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,967
He's saying, rather than
put us out of business,

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,405
he'd prefer to just take us
and make us part of his, um, Hoo...

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,164
Okay, that does sound bad.

25
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,642
But, look, you just had to be there, okay?
He's very articulate.

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,802
Richard, you didn't leave your drink
unattended around Gavin, did you?

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,370
Yeah, you don't sound like yourself.

28
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm fine. And for what it's worth,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,651
Monica thinks
this is the right thing for us to do.

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,446
What?

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,247
You told Monica about this
before you told us?

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,685
I don't know, Gilfoyle.

33
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,764
I guess I thought that Monica would
actually give this rational thought

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,684
as opposed to ordering me
to chortle her balls.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,081
Guys, Richard's right.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,362
It's a pretty good deal, all things considered,

37
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,525
and, Richard, I'd understand if you took it.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,931
Thank you, Jared.

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,443
But Hooli was like an abusive spouse to me.

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,321
You know, like that guy who married
Julia Roberts in <i>Sleeping with</i> the Enemy?

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,448
It was dehumanizing.

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,727
But then, you, Richard,
you pulled me out of the life

43
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,406
and you gave me hope
and you gave me a sense of self-worth.

44
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,086
Like Richard Gere did to Julia Roberts
in <i>Pretty</i> Woman.

45
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,685
- This is weird.
- Every day here

46
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,001
has been like that shopping-spree scene.

47
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,730
- I'm putting on hats.
- <font color="#404040">RICHARD:</font> Okay.

48
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,562
Julia Roberts aside,

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,440
are you guys saying
that you'd rather me let Pied Piper die?

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,289
'Cause that's what's going to happen
if we don't take this deal.

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,761
Face it, Gavin has us cornered.

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,370
He has you cornered.

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,602
Yeah, we can just go work on our apps.

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,245
Sorry, I'm not going to go work for Hooli.

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,006
Same for me,
except for the part about being sorry.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,368
And this buyout sucks.
I'll have nothing to do with it.

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,761
If you're going to go at this one,

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,571
it sounds like you're going
to have to go at it alone, hoss.

59
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,763
Okay, so if I go to Hooli,
you don't want your check?

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,763
Of course I want my check.
What are you, insane?

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,323
But I think it's important for me to show
my dissatisfaction by walking out on you.

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,848
Richard, I'd understand if you took it,

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,605
but watching you end up over there
would break my heart.

you were heading over to Hooli.

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,487
Well, no one ever got laid
putting money in the bank. Am I right?

168
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,848
Those bad boys right there, they're all you.
You gotta flip 'em over. That side's done.

169
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,810
Listen, Richard, I want to back you.

170
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,008
You build whatever the fuck you've got going

171
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,526
in that crazy, fucked-up,
genius brain up there.

172
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,206
It's all up to you.
I'm white glove, hands the fuck off.

173
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,930
Let's make you a billion dollars.

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,650
Let's make me a billion more.
How's that sound?

175
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,206
You're not worried about the lawsuit?

176
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,284
Shit, no. I got three nannies suing me
right now, one of them for no reason.

177
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,361
So come on, let's do this.

178
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,721
Let's kick Gavin Belson's teeth in at CES.

179
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,848
And then when you're really worth something,

180
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,844
I'm gonna take you back
to those same spineless VCs who said no,

181
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,447
and I'm gonna shove you
right up their assholes.

182
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,761
Um...

183
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,683
That's a very enticing offer.

184
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,889
And I wish I didn't have to do this Hooli thing,
but I should probably at least...

185
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,648
"Should"? No, no, Richard.
Don't do what you should do.

186
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,721
Do what you want.

187
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,082
I mean, should I pay 800 bucks
for that tiny piece of meat?

188
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,607
Of course not. But I do it anyway.
Because I want it.

189
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Simple question, Richard,
"What do you want?"

190
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,888
Gentlemen, what's the update on the apps?
Or the app-date, if you will?

191
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,405
I will not.

192
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,448
<font color="#404040">DINESH:</font> Here's my app-date.

193
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,922
I was excited to work on it,
and then I looked at it with fresh eyes.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,562
Wajeed was right. It's really shitty.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.

195
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,880
But I bought your pitch.

196
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,530
Yeah, you fucked up, too.

197
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,841
My app is still great.

198
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,446
But in the time that we've been
clicking around with Pied Piper,

199
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,922
ten other apps that basically
do the exact same thing have come out.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,651
Guys, if I list you as references,

201
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,927
can I count on you
to say nice things about me?

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,047
Be honest.

203
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,441
Do you want me to be honest or nice?

204
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,609
What, did you get
a parking ticket or something?

205
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,729
Yeah, I still can't see it.
Could you use your mouth?

206
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,889
All right. Just read it.

207
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,727
-$5 million?
- Yeah, yeah.

208
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,805
You guys are not going back to Hooli,
and neither am l.

209
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,126
How the fuck did you get that?

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,249
Russ Hanneman?

211
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,322
Oh, Monica, I see you got my text.

212
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,811
Are you out of your mind?

213
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,281
Nice to see you, too, and, no, I'm not.

214
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,091
You're putting your entire future

215
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,926
in the hands of the man
who put radio on the Internet?

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,685
I can only assume
that he mentioned that to you.

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,330
It may have come up.

218
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,121
Oh, this guy. That's the guy?

219
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,725
Yeah, that's the guy.

220
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,806
Does he actually smile like that with
his upper and lower teeth at the same time?

221
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,564
<font color="#404040">MONICA:</font> The guy is a joke.

222
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,766
<font color="#404040">DINESH:</font> How does he even do that?

223
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,003
He's a boorish, pompous,
womanizing douchebag

224
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,244
who got lucky, like, 20 years ago
and hasn't done anything since then.

225
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,086
Sounds like Erlich.

226
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,640
Sounds like he knows who he is
and he doesn't apologize for it.

227
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,330
So he's a joke. Who cares?

228
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,849
This joke is willing to give us $5 million
to fund Pied Piper.

229
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,161
And he doesn't own anything.
This whole thing is a loan.

230
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,687
Yeah, the demand note
is structured as a loan.

231
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,923
But he does have the option
to take repayment in the form of equity,

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,241
and he does get two board seats
right off the bat.

233
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,727
Yeah.
Which means you won't get rid of him, ever.

234
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,371
If you succeed,
he gets a huge chunk of Pied Piper

235
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,445
and if you fail, this lunatic
has ratchets to seize control of the company.

236
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,489
Love it or hate it,
at least Hooli is a real company.

237
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,005
You should take their offer.

238
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,605
I should. I should.

239
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,369
But I'm tired of doing what I should do,

240
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,681
and I kind of want to start doing
what I want to do.

241
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,084
And what I want to do is
be a self-centered, irrational asshole

242
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,448
that doesn't compromise
on anything, at all, ever.

243
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,522
And when Pied Piper is a big fucking deal,

244
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,610
Russ is going to take us back
to all those VCs who passed on us

245
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,286
and shove us right up their fucking assholes.

246
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,081
ERLICHI What?

247
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,686
Yeah, I don't want any part of that last bit.

248
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,649
It sounded better when Russ said it.

249
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,724
Again, I am not good at quoting in context.

250
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,690
It doesn't matter. I'm going to...

251
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,205
I'm going to call Ron LaFlamme,

252
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,886
and I'm going to tell him
that we're taking Russ's money.

253
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,724
Okay, so I'm supposed to tell Laurie Bream

254
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,964
that she is publicly co-invested
with Russ fucking Hanneman?

255
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,884
So, you'd rather me
sell my soul to Gavin Belson

256
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,248
than you just having
an awkward conversation with your boss?

257
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,448
Oh, thanks, Monica.

258
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,887
The guy has calf implants, Richard.

259
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,610

Hello? Did you hear from Hendricks?

264
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,286
What do you mean
he went with someone else?

265
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,771
Who did he go with?

266
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,924
Are you fucking kidding me?

267
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,488
- Russ Hanneman?
- That's right.

268
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,801
The Russ Hanneman with whom I am familiar?

269
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,285
Yes.

270
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,807
That is with whom they chose to go?
Russ Hanneman?

271
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,961
Yes.

272
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,726
He's a vulgar human being.
He's utterly distasteful.

273
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,566
And it would not be inaccurate to say

274
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,371
that we at Raviga

275
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,451
are now co-investors

276
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,810
with Russ Hanneman.

277
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,963
- I tried to talk him out of it. I did, but...
- Mmm-hmm.

278
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,646
You know what?

279
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,371
Peter used to say
that every successful company

280
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,525
could look back at a defining moment early on
where they would have died

281
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,524
had it not been for
the courage and the tenacity

282
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,322
and maybe the insanity of one
visionary person who put it all on the line

283
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,607
even though it seemed
like a huge mistake at the time.

284
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,805
A moment where all the metrics
and the numbers didn't mean anything.

285
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,681
It was all about the emotion.
It was about belief, rational or irrational.

286
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,250
And I think...

287
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,769
I hope that I just witnessed that.

288
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,762
I did not understand
any of what you just said.

289
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,761
Oh...

290
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,887
- None of it?
- None of it.

291
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,682
I will not interact with Russ Hanneman
in any way. Is that clear?

292
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,046
It is, Laurie.

293
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,125
I feel very strongly
that you should have prevented this.

294
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,851
- This exchange is now over.
- Okay, but I...

But now it's down to business.

307
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,807
We have a huge amount of work to do
between now and January.

308
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,484
I know $5 million sounds like a lot of money,

309
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,245
but even if we set
our burn rate conservatively,

310
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,402
it's only going to last 18 months.

311
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,245
Litigation wipes out half our funds
right off the bat.

312
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,006
And we have to stand up servers,
pay for financial and HR,

313
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,766
pay LaFlamme,
and payroll alone is going to be pretty hefty.

314
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,243
Did you see the hiring proposals
that Dinesh and Gilfoyle submitted?

315
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,766
- No.
- They're untenable.

316
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,367
Well, I need four web-app devs,
two front end, two back end.

317
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,762
I need a guy to turn your ref code
into a production-quality library.

318
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,367
I need two more guys
to port the decompression libraries,

319
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,410
do JavaScript, iOS, Android,

320
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,041
and I need a few more guys
to build out our APls,

321
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,771
so I need all those guys.

322
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,406
Ditto. I need every one
of those guys on my list.

323
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,290
Okay, it's just that there's...
That's 15 people each.

324
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,169
I mean, that's like
an entire division at Facebook.

325
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,208
Fine, I could do it with 12.

326
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,647
I could do it with 11
because I'm a better leader than Dinesh.

327
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,290
Okay, great.

328
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,524
Well, good news.
I got them to cut it down to 12 and 11.

329
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,840
A positive step,
but we need to cut a little deeper.

330
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,004
Okay, well, what's the max amount of people
we can afford to hire for them?

331
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,081
Three for each of them.

332
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,725
Three? Are you serious?

333
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,166
Can you just tell them?

334
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,401
Oh, I have, several times.

335
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,963
But they just kept saying if I didn't waste
so much money at the butthole doctor,

336
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,166
then we'd have enough money,

337
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,050
but I pay for all my medical out of pocket.

338
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,370
We can only afford to hire
three people for each of you.

339
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,965
I'm sorry, but that's it.

340
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,566
- Okay, that's fine.
- It works for me.

341
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,166
What?

342
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,289
If you could do it with three people,
why didn't you just say so?

343
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,806
Because we're negotiating against each other.

344
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,965
No, we're not. We're on the same team.
We want the same thing.

345
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,762
Disagree. I just got you to give me three guys
for a job I could easily do with two.

so now I have a few hours to kill.

- Or did I not?
- Yep.

So I can give you
a tour of the premises if you like,

Nah, I'm good.

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,765
Listen, I don't want to disturb the flow.
I just wanted to check out the magic in action.

So I'm gonna grab a seat right over there.

I'm gonna be a fly on the wall.
I'm not gonna say a word. Shh.

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,160
We have a meeting that we were going to do,
so maybe we could just do that?

380
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,682
It was nice to meet you, Russ.

381
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,444
So, uh, I think we'd actually save a lot of time

382
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,127

in regards to the budget.

So what I need from you guys is to...

384
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,242
I'm sorry, do you really talk like that?

385
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,124
- Like what?
- Like that.

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,522

This is my normal speaking voice.

is that real?

388

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,887
Well, this lawsuit is going to be
a protracted and time-consuming ordeal.

413
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,043
But with our superior resources,
top litigators,

414
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,686
we feel this gives us the advantage
over Pied Piper.

415
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,649
Translation?

416
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,170
Ultimately, the suit will turn based on proving
that Pied Piper was created here at Hooli.

Now so far, concrete evidence of that is thin.

Right, but we can offset a lot of that
once we get a few customers

No revenue. I'll call you back.

Why would you go after revenue?

447
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,131
Because to make money.

448
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,929
No.

449

"How much?" And it will never be enough.

But if you have no revenue,
you can say you're pre-revenue.

452
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,569
You're a potential pure play.

453
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,923
It's not about how much you earn,
it's about what you're worth.

454
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,650
And who's worth the most?

455

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,362
You know, Russ,
I've been known to fuck myself.

493
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,120
Well, he's the worst man in America.

494
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,770
And now he owns us.

<font color="#404040">RICHARD:</font> Russ, what's up? Um...

500
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,005
I know you had asked us to concentrate
more on branding and less about the product,

501
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,605
but we were thinking about that and...

502
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,920
I got it.

503
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,967
God?

504
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,202
No. No, shitheads. Look!

Who is that?

<font color="#404040">DINESH:</font> Yeah, how is she Pied Piper?

509
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,521
- What is this?
- Brand awareness.

510
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,364
We're getting Pied Piper out there.

511
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,646
Right.

512
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,364
But what exactly is the product?
I mean, what's... What's this selling?

513
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,204
Pied Piper, idiot.

514
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,362
- I like it.
- Uh-huh.

515
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,809
Yeah, here's the new check I promised you.
This one you can cash.

516
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,804
Obviously, I had to subtract the cost
of the ad agency that nailed that slogan.

517
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,486
The photo, legal, lay-out,
plus the cost of the 15 billboards.

518
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,324
Don't worry,
I gave you guys a sweet deal on them.

519
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,845
- Gave us?
- Yeah.

520
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,321
Hanneman Outdoor Media.
I own the billboards.

521
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,609
That's how I talked the ad agency into
giving you guys that slogan for only 30 grand.

522
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,842
Synergy, bitches. Know what that means?

523
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,686
Does it mean taking a stack of cash
and lighting it on fire?

You fucking guy! Oh, and get this.

526
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,844
I found out where Gavin Belson lives

527
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,925
and I placed 15 of these babies
between his house and his office.

528
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,243
And guess where I placed
the biggest one of all?

529
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,167
<font color="#404040">GAVIN:</font> This is the most
hostile and aggressive act

530
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,891
of provocation I've ever had to endure.

531
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,807
It crosses every line of decency.

This is war.

533
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,004
You better have something good for me.

534
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,970
We believe we have a way to win this case.

535
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,442
What if there were an individual here at Hooli

536
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,404
with whom Hendricks
had had a lot of contact?

537
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,361
What if this individual were, arguably,
a member of the original Pied Piper team?

538
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,763
<i>What if we took steps</i>

539
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,244
<i>to present this individual in a light
such that his talents were undeniable?</i>

540
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,601
<i>Surely an individual this brilliant</i>

541
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,684
<i>would move quickly up the ladder
here at Hooli.</i>

542
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,481
<i>Surely he'd be promoted rapidly
and repeatedly, no?</i>

543
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,645
<i>And surely these impressive promotions
would lead a court to agree</i>

544
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,089
<i>that someone this brilliant,
who was there at the inception of Pied Piper,</i>

545
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,131
<i>must be integral to,
if not solely responsible for its creation.</i>

546
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,611
It's all right. You can come in.

547
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,047
Hmm.

548
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,170
So you're saying the more praise
and promotion we heap on this person,

549
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,165
the more it looks
like Pied Piper was created here at Hooli.

Nothing. Why?
