Again?

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,730
DOCTOR:
Let me ask you something, Richard.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,245
You sure it's not urine,

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,687
and you're not just wetting the bed?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,364
Yeah, I'm sure. It's not.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,885
It's just sweat.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,531
Well, then the medical term for what you have

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,443
is "night sweats."

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,567
Okay.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,927
But night sweats can be a precursor
to bed-wetting,

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,843
and that is very serious.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,641
How serious?

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,563
Like, uh, cancer?

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,642
No! It's embarrassing.

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,166
I mean, you're a grown man, Richard.
Come on.

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,401
That's what children do.

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,960
But I'm not wetting the bed.

21
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,166
Yet!

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,004
How's your stress level been?

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,082
Uh, it's gotten worse. Um...

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,289
I have to get a working beta of my platform
ready in time for January.

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,762
I just took money from a guy
who is a nightmare.

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,080
I hired six new people.

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,561
We're going to have to spend
a ton of money on new offices.

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,565
It's like every second
there is a new issue that I have to solve.

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,927
I am stressed as hell.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,924
Richard, currently, your stress level is here.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,729
And that's night sweats level.

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,361
Got it? Now, if you're not careful
and you let it go up...

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,081
Bed-wetting.

Good. Don't. Definitely.

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,808
Because just thinking about it would probably
stress you out enough to make it happen...

Stop! Would you... Don't say "stress."

I said we should hire movers.

74

I don't do this kind of stuff.

I work with my mind, not with my hands.

In Pakistan, we had servants who did this.

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,965
It wasn't a big deal. We didn't pay them
very much, and they were very happy.

Interesting pitch.

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,368
I will admit, I have never heard
a Christian-oriented riff on dog-sharing.

83
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,564
But Christianity is borderline illegal
in northern California.

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,005
Also, how would you scale?

85
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,130
Well, we could expand
from sharing dogs, to other types of pets.

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,804
Pot-bellied pigs, ferrets...

87

I'm gonna stop you right there.

88

You do know that ferrets are illegal
in the state of California? Hmm?

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,600
No? Well, then I suppose you also don't know

90
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,605
that pot-bellied pigs have been
wildly unfashionable since 2005.

91
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,120
Owning a pot-bellied pig is frowned upon
almost as much as being a Christian.

00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,809
We need servers for that.

174
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,564
What the fuck are we going to do?

175
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,447
I know what the fuck we're going to do.
But you're not going to like it.

176
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,725
We build our own servers.

177
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,925
Gilfoyle, servers are essentially a utility.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,766
I mean, you wouldn't dig a well for water,
or build a generator for power.

179
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,889
I think we should dig our own well,
and build our own generator.

180
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,010
I also think we should store a year's worth of
food and ammunition in a blast cellar.

181
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,445
But we don't.

182
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,488
So good luck when the shit hits the fan.

183
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,842
Look, Richard, we're about precision,

184
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,447
about shaving yoctoseconds off latency
at every layer in the stack.

185
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,921
If we rent from a public cloud,

186
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,210
we're using servers that are, by definition,
generic and unpredictable.

187
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,170
<font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLING)</font> Yeah, but we're already
up against a serious deadline.

188
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,925
I mean, how long is building our own servers
going to set us back?

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,809
If I busted my ass,

190
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,361
I could stand them up inside a week

191
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,441
right here in the house.

192
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,362
Look, Richard, truth is,

193
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,724
this is a huge positive.

194
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,810
I tried running the platform
on my old Bitcoin rig.

195
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,803
At 5,200 gigaflops,

196
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,125
your algorithm flies 800 times faster on GPUs
compared to normal CPUs.

197
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,210
No host could match the config that I build
here in the house.

198
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,601
Oh, and also, we don't seem to have a choice.

199
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,884
But that would cost a ton.

200
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,928
And we don't have that kind of money
just lying around.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,403
It seems as though we do
have that kind of moneyjust lying around.

202
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,403
But that's for the office space.

203
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,448
- Was it?
- No, no, no, no!

204
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,090
Jared, we already signed the lease.

205
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,128
It's too late, right? We can't break a lease.

206
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,043
I mean, we haven't given them the check yet.

207
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,407
- Here it is.
- I could go mail it right now.

208
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,926
In this market, they could
probably find another tenant in a day.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,411
I doubt there would be an issue.

But I failed to do that.

I wouldn't trust you out there in the real world
as far as I could throw you.

My team, using technology developed
at Somerville,

259

was able to devise an array of sensors

shouldn't one return the said gift?
Isn't that what decorum would dictate?

Because if one appreciated a gift

What?

415

Kegels are a form of exercise
that strengthen the pelvic floor.

after childbirth.

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,851
But I have a gift that might make it up to you.

500
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,168
- Is that what I think it is?
- Mmm-hmm.

501
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,241
Oh, boy.

502
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,490
It is 4:00 in the morning! What the...

503
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,805
Why are you both wearing kimonos?

504
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,249
Noah, are you familiar with
the California Fish and Game Code,

505
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,244
section 2116-2126,

506
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,006
with regard to
the possession and harboring of ferrets?

507
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,324
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yeah.

508
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,528
Those little shits are illegal.

509
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,564
Erlich, please, don't. I'll do anything.

510
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,005
Oh, yeah, you will.

511
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,923
We are here to stay,
and you're going to keep that

512
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,368
bearded little hole
in the center of your face shut about it.

513
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,807
- Listen, I was just trying...
- No, you listen.

514
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,360
You're always going on and on
about how this is such a good neighborhood.

515
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,488
Do you know why it's such
a good neighborhood?

516
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,122
Do you know why your shitty house is worth
20 times what you paid for it in the 1970s?

517
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,205
Because of people like us moving in and
starting illegal businesses in our garages.

518
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,486
All the best companies,

519
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,450
Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, even Aviato,

520
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,683
all of them were started in un-zoned garages.

521
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,043
That is why Silicon Valley
is one of the hottest neighborhoods

522
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,485
in the world.

523
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,609
Because of people like us,
not because of people like you.

524
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,927
So if I catch even so much as a dirty glance

525
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,480
or a lascivious look in Richard's direction,

526
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,641
that is it.

527
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,802
Those weasels are dog food.

528
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,251
Okay. Okay.

529
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,526
Um, uh...

530
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,250
-<font color="#DF01D7"> (WHISPERING)</font> Guest house.
- Yes.

531
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,004
Is your guest house currently rented out?

532
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,286
No, it's not for rent.

533
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,601
Well, it mother-fucking is now.

534
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,245
Your new tenant is Jared Dunn.

535
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,324
His rent will be exceedingly reasonable.

536
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,006
And his utilities Will be included.

537
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,245
He speaks German in the night.

538
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,003
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we have an illegal business to run.

539
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,081
Erlich?

540
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,967
<font color="#DF01D7">(GROANS)</font>

541
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,531
But when our scientists did the study,

542
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,329
they found the rate of birth defects
in that territory

543
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,768
was actually higher before
we opened our battery plant there.

544
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,361
But, very good question.
Thank you for that question.

545
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,641
Okay.

546
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,446
Before I finish up here,
I have an announcement.

547
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,525
Today, I have accepted the resignation
of Dr. Davis Bannerchek.

548
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,365
So it pleases me to inform you all
that effective immediately,

549
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,171
Nelson Bighetti has been promoted
to sole head dreamer

550
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,605
Of H00li XYZ.

551
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,201
Sorry, what?

552
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,645
Stand up, Bag Head.

553
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,805
What a meteoric ascension.

554
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,690
Just a few months ago,
you co-founded Pied Piper

555
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,171
and now you've been promoted twice.

556
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,850
It speaks to your competence.

557
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,008
Give it up for Bag Head,
ladies and gentlemen.

558
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,650
And lastly, I have big news.

559
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,691
In anticipation of our big release of Nucleus
at CES in January,

560
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,650
we've decided to give the world
a sneak preview.

561
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,410
Nucleus, in partnership with

562
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,881
Dana White and the
Ultimate Fighting Championship,

563
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,446
will be the exclusive provider
of live streaming

564
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,966
for next month's
Ultimate Fighting Championship event,

565
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,168
Molina versus Bulgakov ll.

566
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,083
I realize the full platform won't be ready
until January,

567
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,130
<i>but our Nucleus division assures me
they are ready for this challenge.</i>

568
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,487
<i>And I can think of no more exciting a way</i>

569
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,444
<i>to give</i> a <i>little taste of Nucleus
to the entire world,</i>

570
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,007
<i>than by putting video latency
in a rear-naked choke hold.</i>

571
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,091
<i>Great job, team. All right, back to work.</i>

572
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,804
Did you, uh, tell Gavin
where we are on the video situation?

573
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,526
He does know that
converting the whole platform to middle-out

574
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,762
has put us at least six weeks
behind schedule, right?

575
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,567
Well, I'm not going to be the one
who tells him we're that far behind.

576
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,369
If you want to, feel free.

577
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,520
I just heard you tell Heidi
we're six weeks behind.

578
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,648
But remember that drop-frame issue
I showed you?

579
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,808
We're easily 15 weeks behind.

580
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,244
Well, I'm not going to be the one
to tell Heidi about that.

581
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,128
Feel free to tell her yourself.

582
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,286
Did I just hear you say
we're only 15 weeks behind?

583
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,604
I've been integrating the system natively...

584
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,808
Dude, I don't even want to know about it.
