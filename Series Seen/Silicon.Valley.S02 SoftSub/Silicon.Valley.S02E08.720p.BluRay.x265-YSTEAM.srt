Seth, the network security guy
from EndFrame,

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,365
just changed his Linkedln status
to "unemployed."

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,046
No way. You think we got him fired?

106

I bet we did. That's awesome.

107
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,410
Well, we never actually breached his security.

108
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,689
Remember we got Marc's login info
and went through the front door?

109
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,330
So, he didn't actually do anything wrong.

110
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,606
He worked for EndFrame,
the pieces of shit that stole our algorithm.

111
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,605
Yeah. So, by the transitive property,
he is, therefore, also a piece of shit.

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,324
Well, the pieces of shit fired him.

113
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,122
So, his "piece of shit" status is reversed.

114
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,204
Okay, fine. So, the transitive property
may no longer apply,

115
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,931
but the reflexive property
states everything is equal to itself.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,129
So, since he's a piece of shit,
he's a piece of shit.

117
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,368
Okay, math aside,

118
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,729
the point I'm trying to make here is
we didn't actually break his code. Okay?

119
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,882
So, he's getting fired for no reason.

120

He's such a dick.

168
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,608
How the fuck did he get into my system?
At least give me a hint.

169
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,965
Something. Anything.

170
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,887
<font color="#DF01D7">(SIGHS)</font>

171
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,121
Fuck.

172
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,806
What if, hypothetically,

173
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,081
there was a certain CEO in your office
that left his login information on a Post-it,

174
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,289
and a certain someone took it
and used that to get in?

175
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,961
Are you saying Gilfoyle
never penetrated my network?

176
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,844
I'm saying you weren't fired

177
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,083
because of anything to do
with your security config.

178
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,846
It wasn't my fault?

179
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,204
- Oh, my God.
- You know what?

180
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,287
I'm glad I came here.

181
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,362
I think it's good
just to get everything out in the open...

182
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,403
That piece of shit!

183
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,642
Gilfoyle kept taunting me and taunting me.

184
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,291
- What're you doing? No, don't call him.
- Hello, Gilfoyle?

185
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,010
- It's Seth.
- Don't mention me or...

186
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,890
Richard just told me about the Post-it,
so fuck you!

187
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,322
You just fucked with the wrong hacker.

188
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,521
There's... There's kids.

189
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,803
I'm gonna skullfuck your whole system.
Fuck you, Gilfoyle!

190
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,446
Fuck you, Richard!
Fuck all of you Pied Piper fucks!

191
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,129
I actually, don't... I don't know him.
I'm just here by myself.

192
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,930
Just watching and waiting.

193
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,489
I love kids. Not like that.

194
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,720
So...

195
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,203
Why would you do that?
Why would you go talk to him?

196
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,204
I don't know, you know.
Face-to-face meetings make things better.

197
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,806
I just felt bad for the guy,
and he was not doing well.

198
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,045
I mean, what if I hadn't said anything
and he'd have, you know, killed himself?

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,248
Yeah, well, there's no chance
of that now, is there?

200
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,051
Richard, you don't seem to understand
what's going on.

201
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,567
We hacked into EndFrame's system
and stole their specs.

202
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,406
You can't go traipsing around
to their former employees

203
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,404
telling them how we did it
just to make them feel better.

204
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,528
You're a fucking black hat now. Act like it.

205
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,921
- What? I'm a black hat? How am I a black hat?
- Shh!

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,161
EndFrame stole from us first.

207
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,801
And since the negative of a negative
is a positive, stealing from a thief is okay.

208
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,325
It's the additive inverse property.

209
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,006
Math aside, Richard, we're all black hats now.

210
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,924
The point is,
what are we gonna do about Seth?

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,001
How do you mean?

212
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,210
Well, I mean, we have an unemployed
and very pissed off systems guy

213
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,410
who very publicly threatened
to skullfuck our whole system.

214
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,524
He's not gonna do shit. He's a coder.

215
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,410
By definition, we're all pussies.

216
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,204
Look, he'll vent for half an hour
and then he'll go LARPing and mogging

217
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,288
and stroke his dick for a while.

218
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,843
Even if he does try to crack us, Richard,
I built our network security myself.

219
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,922
- I'm not worried about it at all.
- So, just...

220
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,285
This doesn't concern you guys?

221
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,246
Okay, because he said, and I quote,
that he was going to skullfuck us!

222
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,443
On. Hey. Hi.

223
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,321
- You have a great daughter.

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,881
Go for Erlich.

226
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,007
Thanks for outing me.

227
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,851
You're gay. That explains so much.

228
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,288
No, outing me for smoking.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,447
I was heading home when my insane boss
called me into the conference room

230
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,803
for some kind of anti-smoking intervention.

231
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,321
"No one ever died from secondhand heroin."
Yeah, she said that.

232
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,482
- What <i>did</i> you say?
- I said nothing.

233
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,804
Jian Yang may have let a little something slip
to your boy Friday,

234
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,484
but don't worry, I covered with aplomb.

235
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,281
That little weasel tells Laurie everything.

236
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,567
On that topic, what did you think of his app?

237
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,211
Well, the fundamental idea is sound.

238
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,931
An app that helps parents
find the least crowded playgrounds.

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,206
Good. So, you understood him.

240
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,286
The problem is, he's basically created
the perfect tool for pedophiles to find victims.

241
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,849
Yes, and pedophiles
are typically not early-adopters,

242
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,526
so we would miss out on that whole market.

243
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,285
<i>That's problematic.</i>

244
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,209
Well, we'll tweak it
when we present it to your boss.

245
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,131
I don't think what I saw
was close to ready for Laurie.

246
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,371
Oh, really, Monica?

247
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,569
Well, I'm sorry that your boss
unearthed your filthy little secret,

248
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,927
but believe it or not,
I actually tried to have your back,

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,207
<i>and I was hoping
you might do the same for me.</i>

250
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,681
Then again, yourjudgment is suspect.
You are a smoker.

251
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,051
I smoke a few cigarettes a week.

253
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,449
Fine. I'll ask Laurie for five minutes,
but that's it.

254
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,445
And tell Jian Yang he better bring it.

255
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,085
Monica, we may never know

256
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,125
what indecipherable Chinese province
Jian Yang comes from,

257
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,044
<i>but I know this much,</i>

258
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,051
Jian Yang was born to bring it,
and you have got to try women.

259
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,131
<i>I mean, just give it</i> a...

260
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,604
I'm sure the work that you have done so far
has been very good.

261
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,651
But now that I am here, the real work begins,

262
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,927
and time is of the essence.

263
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,850
I'm gonna need status reports
from every department.

264
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,567
Where are we?

265
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,685
We have a mobile beta on a HooliPhone.

266
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,446
You wanna see it?

267
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,291
Hmm, yeah.

268
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,241
He quit? What do you mean he quit?

269
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,170
According to security,
he entered the building at 9:13.

270
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,609
He met with the Nucleus team for 11 minutes.
Then he used his key card to exit the building.

271
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,163
Three minutes later, he was clocked at 73
in a 25 zone going past our daycare center.

272
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,729
He never returned, and he hasn't responded
to our calls or e-mail.

273
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,886
Gavin, is it possible that this is a good thing?

274
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,685
Bannerchek was gonna step in
at the last minute

275
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,728
and take a lot of the credit for Nucleus.

276
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,280
Now the world will know
that you're responsible for Nucleus.

277
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,966
You and you alone.

280
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,208
Okay, so, no attempts
to externally access the system? Right?

281
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,807
No SQLi, XSS, worms, Trojans, nothing?

282
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,081
Same answer as I gave you
the last three days. No.

283
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,925
Seth hasn't done shit. We're all good.

284
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,243
Richard, your paranoia
has become officially tedious.

285
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,449
Okay, okay. Our platform is basically built.

286
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,525
Tomorrow, lntersite is gonna start dumping
100 terabytes of video

287
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,883
directly onto our server via fucking FTP.

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,731
We are gonna be the most vulnerable
we've ever been.

289
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,529
And Seth is out there lurking.

290
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,084
Just lurking in the darknet ready to pounce,
like an Internet panther, and we don't care.

291
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,960
Okay, well, frankly,
your lack of paranoia is insane to me.

292
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,411
Now you're paranoid
that we're not paranoid enough?

293
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,803
You're para-paranoid, Richard.

294
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,251
- Where are you going?
- To the kitchen.

295
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,441
Why are you going together?

296
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,726
Are you gonna talk about me?

00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,450

And I want you to know I'm not gonna do
any of those things that I threatened to do.

00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,482
Really? Just to be clear,
no skullfucking of any kind?

302
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,404
No. I guess I just needed to vent.

303
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,201
Actually, I was pretty worried
that you were gonna do something crazy.

304
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,206
You can relax.

305
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,488
And please tell Gilfoyle
I'm sorry for what I said,

307
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,327
Uh...

308
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,563
You don't have to worry about Gilfoyle.
He couldn't have cared less.

309
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,925
- Really?
- Yeah.

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,166
You know, I gotta be honest.
I mean, I'm really glad I came back here.

311
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,369
I mean, Dinesh and Gilfoyle
obviously said it was a bad idea,

312
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,965
especially given what happened.

313
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,840
But this just really restores my faith
that face-to-face meetings are the way to...

314
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,161
That smug cocksucker
didn't think I had the skills

315
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,163
to break into his system, that motherfucker.

316
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,844
What? What are you... Don't...
Who are you calling?

317
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,651
- Hello, Gilfoyle. It's Seth again.
- Hey, don't mention that I...

318
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,927
Richard here just told me
you're not afraid of me.

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,731
Well, you know what
I'm gonna do to you now, motherfucker?

320
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,325
Get out our here. Scatter. Scatter.

321
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,607
I'm skullfucking the shit out
of your system this time.

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,207
How you like me now, you cocksucking,
motherfucking piece of shit?

323
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,850
In our initial build,

324
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,930
we realized that the same
geo-tagging technology

325
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,607
that could be used to locate
uncrowded playgrounds

326
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,810
could also be used to prey on children,
our greatest natural resource,

327
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,282
by one of
society's worst elements, pedophiles.

328
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,725
The pedophile facing nature of the app
would present marketing pain points. Yes.

329
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,007
But under Monica's guidance,

330
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,527
we realized the same technology
could also be used

331
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:35,085
to create a real-time, crowd-sourced map
of an even worse segment of the population.

332
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,846
- Worse than pedophiles?
- Smokers.

333
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,406
Oh.

334
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,530
Because, let's face it,
no one's ever died of secondhand heroin.

335
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,926
True.

336
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,767
True.

337
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,367
With our app, users can locate and thus avoid

338
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,571
these self-indulgent,
self-destructive, negligent monsters.

339
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,085
- Negligent?
- Yeah.

340
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,803
We call it "Smokation."

341
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,046
It's a clever hybrid
of "smoker" and "location."

342
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,330
It's interesting.

343
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,805
It's interesting.

344
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,810
Well done. Well done.

345
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,690
So, what kind of term sheet
do you think she's gonna lay on us?

346
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,888
There's a lot of work to do,

347
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,123
but you certainly knew
how to play to your audience.

348
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,686
So, I'd say it looks good.

We even killed the Wi-Fi and reverted back
to this Stone Age hard line Ethernet switch.

of your premium content?

492
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,443
Yes, we did.

493
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,604
And that is bad, certainly.

494
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,643
But the way we did it.

495
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,369
See, our compression
is so incredibly powerful

496
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,411
that we were able to delete all those files

497
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,087
at a rate that until now was unthinkable.

498
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,369
If we're considering just raw speed.

499
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,170
So, uh, just bear in mind,

500
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,483
you know, when making your final decision,

501
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,885
had EndFrame accidentally
put a tequila bottle on their delete key,

502
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,163
I guarantee, they would have struggled
to delete half the amount of files that we did.

503
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,607
At best.

504
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,483
Or worst. I could also...

505
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,483
lcould... l...

506
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,131
- Ended up being the worst.
- Worst.

507
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,001
- Definitely.
- Yeah.

508
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,686
But you know what? Um...

509
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,845
L.-

510
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,328
I'm actually glad
that we came here today, all of us,

511
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,771
because this is good.

512
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,288
Because now more than ever, in these times,

513
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,923
meeting face-to-face...

514
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,965
Get out.

515
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,047
- All of us or just...
- Now. All of you.

516
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,851
Okay.

517
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,571
Thank you for your time.

518
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,523
I would be remiss if I didn't mention that

519
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,008
your sites are some of my
primary destinations...

520
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,445
- Out.
- Okay.
