1
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:32,386
Dick Whitman, you watch where you're going.

2
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:33,651
You're going to break your neck.

3
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,992
You going to cry or get up?

4
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:45,669
I'm getting up, Uncle Mack.

5
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,365
Good. There's someone
who wants to meet you.

6
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,102
What are you afraid of?

7
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:55,076
There was lots of screaming.

8
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,545
Always is.

9
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,810
The Lord has given us a blessing.

10
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:03,080
You have a new brother.

11
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:06,187
He ain't my brother.

12
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:09,192
Of course he is.
You got the same daddy.

13
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,761
Isn't he beautiful?

14
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:14,127
I named him Adam after the first man.

15
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:27,578
Daddy!

16
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,408
Don, are you all right?

17
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,186
Happy Mother's Day.

18
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,637
This is fascinating.

19
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,711
It's better than the Hollywood version.

20
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,406
It's certainly dirtier.

21
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:39,416
Well, Joan Crawford is not what she was.

22
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:41,610
You know, honestly,

23
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,712
I found her eyebrows completely unnerving,

24
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,381
like a couple of...

25
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:49,460
caterpillars just pasted there.

26
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:55,894
Her standing next to Suzy Parker
as if they were the same species.

27
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:59,198
Well, some men like eyebrows,

28
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:02,034
and all men like Joan Crawford.

29
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,234
Salvatore couldn't stop talking about her.

30
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:12,044
To think, one of the great beauties,
and there she is, so old.

31
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,119
I'd just like to disappear at that point.

32
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,620
It makes perfect sense.

33
00:04:19,424 --> 00:04:21,016
I promise you, Bets,

34
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:25,153
the first sign of crow's feet,
and I'll put you on an ice floe.

35
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,232
Or would you prefer to be
my gal in the iron mask?

36
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,228
Did you have a nice Mother's Day?

37
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:36,302
It was lovely.

38
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:42,379
My mother was at least two years older
than whatever Joan Crawford says she is,

39
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,540
and she was still very fetching.

40
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,310
I'd like to think that
she'd stand up very well

41
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:52,288
as a prediction of my
eventual appearance.

42
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,291
Bets, don't.

43
00:04:57,262 --> 00:05:00,060
No melancholy.

44
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,601
I'm allowed to be sentimental
on Mother's Day.

45
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:05,499
But it's your Mother's Day, not hers.

46
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:09,404
I'm just saying that my mother
looked handsome.

47
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:14,042
Actually, vivacious
and positively cheerful,

48
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:16,079
right up to her end.

49
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:19,244
It's good remembrance.

50
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,911
Dr. Wayne suggested a book which...

51
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,081
says that it's part
of the mourning process.

52
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,989
Dr. Wayne.

53
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,291
I do think it's helping.

54
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,592
So you're cured?

55
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,894
I don't know how they tell that.

56
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,197
When their vacation house is paid for.

57
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,902
Don't deride him.

58
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:50,645
Mourning is just extended self-pity.

59
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:53,944
In New Guinea,

60
00:05:54,052 --> 00:06:01,390
pygmies grind up their ancestors
and drink the powder in a beer.

61
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:05,020
And a model culture at that, pygmies.

62
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,724
Did you know Michelangelo
was painting the Sistine ceiling

63
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:13,031
when those people were still
living in caves discovering fire?

64
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,265
I didn't know that.

65
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, it's true.

66
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,474
Introduction to Basic Anthropology.

67
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:24,073
What about...

68
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:26,412
Advanced Reproduction?

69
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:29,316
How are your studies
progressing in that?

70
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,685
Completed.

71
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,122
I got an A, actually.

72
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:35,123
You did?

73
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,057
Yep, I did.

74
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:39,596
I flunked the whole thing.

75
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:42,326
Well, that's because
you got caught cheating.

76
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,878
Get the light.

77
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,153
I want you so much.

78
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,123
I thought about it all day.

79
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,599
Me, too.

80
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,503
No, I mean it.

81
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:27,002
It's all I think about...

82
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,374
every day.

83
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:33,416
Your car coming down the driveway.

84
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,552
I put the kids to bed early.

85
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:42,287
I make a grocery list.
I cook butterscotch pudding.

86
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,359
I never let my hands idle.

87
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:46,725
Brushing my hair,

88
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:49,994
drinking my milk...

89
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:52,296
and it's all in a kind of fog

90
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:55,099
because I can't stop
thinking about this.

91
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:02,706
I want you so badly.

92
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:08,508
You have me.

93
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:13,850
You do.

94
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,583
Ah, Don.

95
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,090
You remember Nick Rodis
from Olympic Cruise Lines.

96
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:50,093
Nick, did you ever add
that second deck of portholes?

97
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:53,255
Yes, but those rooms get pretty wet.

98
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:57,425
This is Urine Ben Shulhai
from The Israel Ministry of Tourism.

99
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:58,797
It is pronounced "Yoram. "

100
00:08:58,903 --> 00:08:59,870
Of course.

101
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,495
And this young lady is Lily Meyer.

102
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:02,971
Pleasure to meet you.

103
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,405
And you.

104
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:07,376
Caviar, blinis, mai tais.

105
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:10,379
We're thinking of a land of exotic luxury.

106
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:13,348
We'd like to think that if Beirut
is the Paris of the Middle East,

107
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:15,214
Haifa can be the Rome.

108
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,878
It's an exciting idea.

109
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:18,216
Of course we should keep in mind

110
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:21,554
that Paris has the Eiffel Tower
and Rome has the Coliseum.

111
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,093
And Tel Avenue is about to have a Hilton.

112
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,356
Olympic is charting
our most luxurious liner

113
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:30,025
all along the wondrous ports
of the Israeli Riviera.

114
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:33,592
We are going to visit
Mr. Bernbach down the street,

115
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,572
but some of us
find his humor to be kitsch.

116
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:40,132
We thought we would try
a traditional way as well.

117
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:44,079
Sterling Cooper doesn't
like to think of itself as traditional.

118
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:49,142
Maybe that is the wrong word.
My English is not so good.

119
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,916
Glamour, like glamorous... that's the word.

120
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,581
We saw your awards.

121
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:56,353
We were impressed
with your work on Rio de Janeiro.

122
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:57,826
You're not thinking of putting

123
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:01,365
a 150-foot statue of Jesus
in Tel Aviv, are you?

124
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:03,331
Because that's how we sold Rio.

125
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:07,427
This book has been
on the best-seller list

126
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:09,369
for two years in the States,

127
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:12,807
and is soon to be a major motion picture
starring Paul Newman.

128
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:17,541
America has a love affair with Israel,

129
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,346
and we would like to bring
the two parties together.

130
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:24,819
Well, you certainly
saved me some legwork.

131
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,390
All I have is the Bible.

132
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,356
Let's stay away from that.

133
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:35,193
So, your ideal tourist.

134
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,892
What's his yearly salary?

135
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,968
Whatever you make.

136
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:42,505
They always say that.

137
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:59,116
Well, look who's here:
A couple of angels.

138
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:00,747
Do we have lunch today?

139
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:03,588
No, darling, we're going
to get Margaret a haircut.

140
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,128
A haircut?

141
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,719
Oh, I like your ponytail, squirt.

142
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:07,923
It makes you look young.

143
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,701
I like your hair, Daddy.
It makes you look old.

144
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,999
We just have to find the right place.

145
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,200
Ginger?

146
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,004
I cut my own hair.

147
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,505
You picked her.

148
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,146
Don't you two make a handsome couple.

149
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,412
Honestly, I don't go for handsome.

150
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,549
Mona, Margaret.

151
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,818
What brings you below 59th Street?

152
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:36,086
Margaret, say hello.

153
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,630
Hello, Mr. Draper.

154
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,366
Oh, Mona, aren't you lucky?

155
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:45,231
Mother and daughter on the town.

156
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,804
Where are the girls
getting their hair done these days?

157
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,532
By girls, you mean Brigitte Bardot?

158
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,232
Because that's what I'm seeing.

159
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:54,436
As long as she can pin
a hat on it for church.

160
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:56,308
You are going to love this man.

161
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,109
I will make you an appointment. Come on.

162
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,249
Bye, Don.

163
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:03,377
Roger, sweetheart.

164
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,957
She used to love being in my office.

165
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:12,654
Her haircut is the least
of Margaret's problems.

166
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,790
She's dated what, two boys?

167
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,131
One of them joined the service,
the other one committed suicide.

168
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:23,102
She doesn't want to go to college.

169
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:24,469
Doesn't want to work.

170
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,133
Not interested in charity.

171
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:29,612
I don't know what we did wrong.

172
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:32,615
We gave her everything she wanted,
and she's still useless.

173
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:33,911
You're being too hard on her.

174
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,179
She's a young girl.

175
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,255
When I was her age,
I rode a tramp steamer

176
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:39,914
from Bar Harbor to Hilton Head.

177
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,252
I bet it was a yacht.

178
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:43,793
Someone still has to sail those things.

179
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,590
I think Margaret reminds you of you.

180
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,027
You're both spoiled.

181
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,189
Zip.

182
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:54,996
Come back to bed.

183
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,438
We can stay here all afternoon.

184
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,305
You don't have to go back to work.

185
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,173
I do. Zip.

186
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:05,579
You like the pearl necklace I gave you?

187
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:06,672
It's gorgeous.

188
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,118
Aren't you even going to have any of this?

189
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:16,751
Look, we've got Oysters Rockefeller,
Beef Wellington, Napoleons.

190
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:20,126
If we leave this lunch alone,
it'll take over Europe.

191
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,892
I don't like eating in here.

192
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:26,095
Food that close to the bed
reminds me of a hospital.

193
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:28,297
If you had your own apartment,
we could go to your place.

194
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:29,964
You could cook for me.

195
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:33,271
Don't you like things the way they are?

196
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:35,311
Are you kidding?

197
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:38,314
This has been the best year of my life.

198
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,474
Do you have any idea

199
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,814
how unhappy I was before I met you?

200
00:13:43,888 --> 00:13:46,152
I was thinking of leaving my wife.

201
00:13:49,193 --> 00:13:54,221
I'm just getting tired of all the...
sneaking around.

202
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:55,822
Aren't you?

203
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:00,364
Roger, I know as much about men
as you know about advertising,

204
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:03,668
and I know that the sneaking around
is your favorite part.

205
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:07,642
You know, I have a lot of favorite parts.

206
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,170
I'd like to get you...

207
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,273
a little fourth floor walk-up somewhere

208
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:15,682
with no doors, no windows,

209
00:14:15,786 --> 00:14:18,050
and lock you up for a week.

210
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:22,024
That's tempting.

211
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,720
But I like hotels.

212
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:27,593
You leave with what you came in with.

213
00:14:27,698 --> 00:14:30,292
And little soaps. I love those.

214
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:34,060
I wish I knew what you wanted, Joanie.

215
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:37,566
I love this, Roger,

216
00:14:37,675 --> 00:14:42,703
but a week is a considerable length of time,
and I have my own world.

217
00:14:42,813 --> 00:14:46,544
I go out, and I have parties,
and I have friends over...

218
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:48,243
Male friends?

219
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:49,614
Yes.

220
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,778
I don't want to hear this.

221
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,288
Carol and I have this nice little rotation.

222
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,155
Carol. The disaster.

223
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,818
I've known Carol since college,

224
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,362
and she's been a good friend,

225
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:01,795
and she's bright, and she's neat.

226
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,127
So you think you'd be lonely.

227
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,302
I think it would be
half as much fun alone.

228
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:08,895
You could get a bird.

229
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,167
They're fairly neat for animals.

230
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,571
Roger, if you had your way,

231
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:20,651
I would be stranded
in some paperweight

232
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,582
with my legs stuck in the air.

233
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:23,881
Wait, wait, wait.

234
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:25,751
You're just gonna paint
that picture and go, huh?

235
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:34,663
Can't we... just enjoy this?

236
00:15:34,765 --> 00:15:42,171
I mean, we both know I'll eventually find
a more permanent situation,

237
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:46,903
and you'll find a new model.

238
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:50,469
The '61s are coming out soon.

239
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:53,573
I hear the fins are bigger next year.

240
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,617
Whatever you want, Red.

241
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,040
I see why they want the guns.

242
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:23,078
It's tough to compete

243
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,910
with Bermuda only three hours away.

244
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:28,542
It helps if they stop blowing up hotels.

245
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:31,554
Oh, kill me, you busty Jewess.

246
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,260
Maybe we should try and exploit
the danger instead of fighting it.

247
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,827
Travel as adventure.

248
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,361
Or how about this?

249
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:43,797
Average American family of three
standing on shore, suitcases in hand.

250
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,596
The Red Sea parts before them.

251
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:49,366
On the other side
waits a gleaming four-star resort.

252
00:16:49,473 --> 00:16:51,338
Shouldn't you see the Promised Land?

253
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,273
Take religion out.

254
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:56,403
They've got plenty of
Stations of the Cross traffic.

255
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:59,347
I've skimmed this research,
and the whole thing's pretty red.

256
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,942
These communes, kibbutzes.

257
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:04,282
It's positively Soviet.

258
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:08,055
Except the Daughters
of the American Revolution

259
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:09,888
are shuttling this book
up and down Fifth Avenue.

260
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:11,325
It's a good story.

261
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:12,521
They start in these prison camps.

262
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,097
Like, real prisoners.

263
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:17,167
Then the next thing you know,
they're in the desert, armed to the teeth,

264
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:20,362
cutting their way through the enemy,
dying for the cause.

265
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,995
And then they have a government.

266
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:23,767
A commie government.

267
00:17:23,874 --> 00:17:25,842
Made my mother cry.

268
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:30,744
So, we have a quasi-communist state
where women have guns,

269
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:32,406
and it's filled with Jews.

270
00:17:32,516 --> 00:17:33,847
Well, not completely filled.

271
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,714
Let's not forget that there are also Arabs.

272
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,412
They've got oranges.

273
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,818
As far as I can see,

274
00:17:38,923 --> 00:17:41,551
the biggest thing
this place has going for it:

275
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:44,355
The people are good-looking.

276
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:47,295
The Jews there don't
look like the Jews here.

277
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:49,866
Have you been to the Diamond District?

278
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,766
All right. I have to make
a couple phone calls.

279
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:55,930
Let's pick this up later.

280
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,543
Peggy, will you get me
a private line, please?

281
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,512
Right away, Mr. Draper.

282
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:24,759
<i>Donald Draper, Line 2.</i>

283
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,105
I debated not taking the call.

284
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:40,615
I'm glad you did. I need to see you.

285
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:42,618
I don't think that's a good idea.

286
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:44,980
<i>It's business.</i>

287
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:46,647
Meet me for a drink.

288
00:18:46,757 --> 00:18:48,088
I'm busy this evening.

289
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,183
I wouldn't have called
if it wasn't important.

290
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:52,660
<i>I should still be able to talk to you.</i>

291
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:54,162
<i>Give me credit for that.</i>

292
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:58,798
Lunch. Tomorrow.

293
00:18:58,903 --> 00:18:59,995
Lunch.

294
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:03,673
<i>The Tea Room at The Pierre, 12:15.</i>

295
00:19:03,774 --> 00:19:05,105
Message received.

296
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:30,665
Oh, it's so muggy tonight.

297
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,032
Did you just get a library card?

298
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,471
I rarely see you read anything

299
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:40,305
that doesn't have a manila folder
wrapped around it.

300
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,680
You should clean the gutters.

301
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:47,044
This weekend.

302
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:49,210
Is that good?

303
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:53,088
There's less action than I thought.

304
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,215
I thought it was a romance.

305
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,019
You know, the first boy
I ever kissed was Jewish.

306
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:02,856
How did that happen?

307
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:06,198
My friend Deirdre Shaw
was friends with a Jewish girl,

308
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:11,070
Beth... Gold, Silver, or something.

309
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:15,635
Beth invited us to a mixer
at her synagogue in Lower Merion.

310
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:17,338
I'm surprised your mother let you go.

311
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:21,781
Well, it was a fundraiser for charity.

312
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:24,446
Those poor skinny people in the boats.

313
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:27,183
This boy danced with me all evening.

314
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:30,089
David Rosenberg.

315
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:32,128
He was very good-looking,

316
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:35,255
but there was something
about him that was gloomy.

317
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,698
Was he a good kisser?

318
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,068
Let's just say he had
more practice than I did.

319
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:44,766
Yeah, I'm sure he was very disappointed.

320
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,706
Oh, please. The only
reason he picked me

321
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,641
is because I wasn't
part of the synagogue.

322
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:50,543
In fact, the next day, on the school bus,

323
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:53,879
Beth told everyone I was necking
with David Rosenberg.

324
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:55,713
The looks they gave me.

325
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:02,223
They were all blondes by the next summer.

326
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,401
Honey, it's hot.

327
00:21:15,573 --> 00:21:18,269
And I have to read this book about the desert.

328
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,608
Of course.

329
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:22,974
Go ahead.

330
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:29,215
We should get
an air conditioner up here.

331
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,720
We'll see.

332
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:41,795
Hiya, fellas. Come on in.

333
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,560
Did you see this?

334
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,498
Someone broke into
the Yankees' equipment locker

335
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,592
in Cleveland yesterday.

336
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:48,604
Swiped Mickey Mantle's pet glove.

337
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:50,571
Huh. They should have taken his bat.

338
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:53,700
Shall we wait for you
to have your breakfast?

339
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,837
A day without orange juice
is a hell of a long day.

340
00:21:56,947 --> 00:21:58,574
Hey, look, Ma, no hands.

341
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,212
"Belle Jolie"?

342
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,651
Yeah, I've been looking at the work
of our esteemed predecessors.

343
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:06,347
I'm not heartened.

344
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:07,788
They make more colors of lipstick

345
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:09,688
than Howard Johnson
has ice cream flavors,

346
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:11,727
but their sales are in the crapper.

347
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:13,023
These names.

348
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,757
Passion Flower Peach,

349
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:16,492
Tropical Boudoir Red.

350
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,329
And look, Ethel Rosenberg Pink.

351
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:21,404
Wear it to the chair.

352
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:23,439
Did you know that lipstick was invented

353
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,499
to simulate the flush on a woman's face
after you treated her right?

354
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:30,341
If you're going to quote
the research report,

355
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:31,971
don't start with "Did you know?"

356
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:37,786
Research, I'm stumped.

357
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,356
I'll be honest. I don't speak Moron.

358
00:22:40,457 --> 00:22:42,516
Do either of you speak Moron?

359
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,894
Let's throw it to the chickens.

360
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:52,298
Okay, girls, come on in.

361
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:54,462
Come on in, ladies. Gather around.

362
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:00,803
Settle down.

363
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,310
What, no lunch?

364
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:04,973
No, dear. This is better.

365
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:06,549
Belle Jolie wants us to tell them

366
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,141
what we think about their
new line of lipsticks.

367
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:17,283
One-way glass.

368
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,726
That name seem weird to you?

369
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,593
Should be two-way glass, right?

370
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,428
I don't care what they call it.

371
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:25,968
Beats the hell out of X-ray Specs.

372
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:28,995
It's called brainstorming.

373
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:30,368
That sounds intimidating.

374
00:23:30,474 --> 00:23:32,237
Is it like a test?

375
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:33,400
There are no wrong answers.

376
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,704
You just be your pretty little selves.

377
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:37,508
Grab a lipstick,
grab a mirror, and sit down.

378
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:44,015
Oh, this one's too red for me.

379
00:23:46,623 --> 00:23:48,887
And remember, the mirror
could be your best friend

380
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,392
or your worst enemy.

381
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:56,259
Has no taste.

382
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:59,362
Ugly dress.

383
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:04,938
Horrible wig.

384
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:09,307
They're brainstorming.

385
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:12,644
I wouldn't expect more
than a few sprinkles.

386
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,650
I love it when they do that.

387
00:24:14,752 --> 00:24:16,185
My little blowfish.

388
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,957
Anybody mind if I take off my pants?

389
00:24:25,662 --> 00:24:27,323
The red one's for me.

390
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:28,989
How many lipsticks do you own?

391
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,828
Gee, I don't know.

392
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:32,799
I'd have to go home and count.

393
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:38,000
Do you match your lip color
to your clothing or to your accessories?

394
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,042
I know. That seems
like a loaded question.

395
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,203
It is unloaded,

396
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:45,042
and I insist you curb
your editorial comments.

397
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:47,674
Sometimes I match it to my nail polish.

398
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:50,481
Good answer. Go ahead.

399
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:52,919
Do you change your lip color
with the seasons?

400
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,022
You, stand over there.

401
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,703
At what point do we start running electricity
through the chairs?

402
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:13,299
You should have put a man in there
so they'd take it seriously.

403
00:25:16,113 --> 00:25:17,011
Good.

404
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:18,775
I was afraid I'd missed it.

405
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:38,098
I want to stand and salute that.

406
00:25:49,446 --> 00:25:51,414
What's with Mouse Ears over there?

407
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,619
Thanks for coming.

408
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:03,743
Can I get you anything?

409
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:05,048
No.

410
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,651
How've you been?

411
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:11,659
Fine.

412
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:13,229
Tired.

413
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:15,859
It doesn't show.

414
00:27:17,768 --> 00:27:21,033
I'm in the middle of spring inventory.

415
00:27:21,138 --> 00:27:22,765
I hope you're not going to tell me

416
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:26,001
that the grand plan
for remaking our store has a hitch in it.

417
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:29,872
You look beautiful.

418
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,972
I thought you had
urgent business to discuss.

419
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:35,541
Anything for the lady?

420
00:27:35,652 --> 00:27:37,882
Nothing for me... Mmm, coffee.

421
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:38,955
Irish coffee?

422
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:40,250
Coffee.

423
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,315
Yes, sir.

424
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:47,257
Business?

425
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:54,198
It turns out Israel Tourism
is considering becoming a client,

426
00:27:54,304 --> 00:27:56,465
and I'm having a hard time
getting a handle on it.

427
00:27:56,573 --> 00:27:58,666
And I'm the only Jew
you know in New York City?

428
00:27:58,775 --> 00:28:00,640
You're my favorite.

429
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:03,736
Jesus, Don, crack a book once in a while.

430
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,212
I have.

431
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:08,011
It's all sentimental World War II trivia,

432
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:10,814
oranges, kids in blue and white hats.

433
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,912
<i>They're doing a movie of Exodus
with Paul Newman.</i>

434
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:15,287
Paul Newman? That's nice.

435
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:16,882
Now I have two reasons to see it.

436
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,091
Damn it.

437
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,394
You're usually so put together.

438
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,736
Thank you.

439
00:28:38,682 --> 00:28:41,810
I'll say one thing about Israelis.

440
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:43,385
Don't cross them.

441
00:28:44,755 --> 00:28:48,748
Well, those people at the meeting
were definitely Zionists.

442
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:52,260
Zion just means Israel.

443
00:28:52,362 --> 00:28:54,159
It's a very old name.

444
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:57,396
I'm sorry. I'm not an expert on this,

445
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:59,492
and something feels strange
about being treated like one.

446
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:01,195
I just want to know something about it

447
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:03,670
that doesn't come from
some ministry of propaganda.

448
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:06,743
Well, here's some more
World War II trivia.

449
00:29:06,843 --> 00:29:09,368
They just arrested Adolf Eichmann
in Argentina last week.

450
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,605
Have you seen his resume?

451
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,483
Okay, I deserved that.

452
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:18,145
But I'm talking about
tourists going to Israel.

453
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:20,189
I don't know what I can say.

454
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,386
I'm American.
I'm really not very Jewish.

455
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,428
If my mother hadn't died having me,

456
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,430
I could have been Marilyn
instead of Rachel.

457
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:29,897
No one would know the difference.

458
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,228
What is the difference?

459
00:29:34,404 --> 00:29:39,239
Look, Jews have lived
in exile for a long time:

460
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,003
First in Babylon,

461
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:44,638
then all over the world... Shanghai, Brooklyn...

462
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:48,912
and we've managed to make a go of it.

463
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:50,350
Maybe it has something to do

464
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:52,115
with the fact that we
thrive at doing business

465
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:53,951
with people who hate us.

466
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,788
I don't hate you.

467
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:01,492
No. Individuals are wonderful.

468
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:02,929
That's not what I meant.

469
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:05,928
I don't know.

470
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:09,361
A country...

471
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,532
for "those people," as you call us,

472
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,973
well...

473
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:15,601
it seems very important.

474
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:19,647
Then why aren't you there?

475
00:30:19,749 --> 00:30:21,717
My life is here.

476
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:23,809
My grandfather came from Russia,

477
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,979
now we have a store on Fifth Avenue.

478
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:28,489
I'll visit, but I don't have to live there.

479
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,993
It just... has to be.

480
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,528
For me, it's more
of an idea than a place.

481
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:39,158
Utopia.

482
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:42,933
Maybe.

483
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:52,275
They taught us at Barnard about that word.

484
00:30:52,382 --> 00:30:54,612
Utopia.

485
00:30:56,553 --> 00:30:58,953
The Greeks had two meanings for it:

486
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:00,317
<i>"Eu-topos,"</i>

487
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,584
meaning "the good place,"

488
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:05,991
<i>and "ou-topos,"</i>

489
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:08,826
meaning "the place that cannot be. "

490
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:15,901
I have to get back to the office.

491
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:24,838
I better not see this on my bill.

492
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,411
Okay, girls, playtime's over.

493
00:31:31,521 --> 00:31:34,285
Time to put down your lipsticks
and head back to your desks.

494
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:37,087
Thank you for your cooperation
and your lips.

495
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:39,685
These go in the closet.

496
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:49,233
Well, now we have to count
the shades they tried.

497
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,637
Can you bring me those tissues, dear?

498
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:57,610
Here's your basket of kisses.

499
00:31:57,714 --> 00:31:59,648
Basket of kisses.

500
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:00,875
That's cute.

501
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:02,611
Who told you that?

502
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:05,244
What do you mean?

503
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:06,822
Where did you hear that?

504
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:08,652
I just thought of it.

505
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:11,226
Isn't that what it is?

506
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:15,394
It is, sweetheart.

507
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:17,056
Which color did you like?

508
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,691
I didn't get the one I liked.

509
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:20,463
Someone took my color.

510
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,128
Why didn't you choose another one?

511
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,070
I'm very particular.

512
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:27,268
As opposed to the other girls?

513
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:29,572
I don't know.

514
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,013
I don't think anyone wants to be
one of a hundred colors in a box.

515
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:35,675
I think that's enough complaining.

516
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:37,912
Why don't you head
back to your desk, Peggy?

517
00:32:41,825 --> 00:32:45,727
Bet you wish you could pour
that in a glass and drink it.

518
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:06,543
Peggy, clear the rest of my afternoon,
would you, please?

519
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,949
<i>You have the Snider's
Catsup people at 3:00.</i>

520
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:13,853
Have a box of cigars sent over to Jim King
with my apologies.

521
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:15,788
<i>I'll find out what he smokes.</i>

522
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:17,382
Good girl.

523
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:19,955
You got a minute, Chief?

524
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:21,928
Just.

525
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:23,192
You don't mind, do you?

526
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,665
Use a glass, Freddie.

527
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:28,564
Your girl is full of surprises.

528
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:31,004
Oh, pretty Peggy Sue.

529
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:33,166
Peggy?

530
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:35,039
If you say so.

531
00:33:35,145 --> 00:33:37,170
I try to avoid eye contact

532
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,180
to avoid being blinded
by the earnestness.

533
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,181
Actually, she really stood out,
brainstorming-wise.

534
00:33:44,287 --> 00:33:45,845
Brainstorming?

535
00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:47,286
Sorry I missed that.

536
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,948
What was the line?

537
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:50,686
A bucket of kisses.

538
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:51,988
Basket of kisses.

539
00:33:52,095 --> 00:33:52,993
Bucket sounds better.

540
00:33:53,096 --> 00:33:54,563
If you like 'em wet and sloppy.

541
00:33:55,598 --> 00:33:56,758
The point is,

542
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:59,801
while the rest of the hens were busy
pulling out each other's feathers,

543
00:33:59,903 --> 00:34:01,894
that one saw the benefit, not the feature.

544
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:03,370
Really?

545
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:07,068
Yeah. She said she didn't want to be one
of a hundred colors in a box.

546
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:11,007
That's interesting, isn't it?

547
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:13,514
It is.

548
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:17,347
It was like watching a dog play the piano.

549
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,222
<i>It's me, Barbara. Can you talk?</i>

550
00:34:29,332 --> 00:34:31,266
She's still sleeping, thank God.

551
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:32,460
What's on your mind?

552
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:35,538
I think I might have met somebody.

553
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:38,471
You're not sure? That's good.

554
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:41,601
He has some serious limitations.

555
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:43,110
<i>Does he work in the store?</i>

556
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:45,408
No, he doesn't work at the store.

557
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:47,142
He has a job, doesn't he?

558
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,547
<i>Yes.</i>

559
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:49,913
Then what's the problem?

560
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:51,543
Would Daddy like him?

561
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:54,216
Daddy would hate him.

562
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:55,951
So he's not Jewish.

563
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:00,822
<i>Who cares what Daddy thinks?</i>

564
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,626
He's not your boyfriend anymore.

565
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:04,791
Barbara.

566
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:06,095
<i>You're 28 years old.</i>

567
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:07,464
<i>You work 60 hours a week.</i>

568
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,902
The last thing you want
is to end up like Aunt Rosie,

569
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:12,167
lying to your nieces about
how many engagements you had.

570
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,106
Aunt Rosie wasn't lying.

571
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,337
Oh, please, there was
no Max the Communist.

572
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:18,607
<i>Does he have all his hair?</i>

573
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,046
More than he'll ever need.

574
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,640
<i>Is he funny?</i>

575
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:24,720
Sometimes. After a couple.

576
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:28,154
<i>So he's a shikker. Daddy will hate him.</i>

577
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:31,694
I do feel this attraction.

578
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:32,989
I want him,

579
00:35:33,096 --> 00:35:35,189
and I want to ignore
everything else about him.

580
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:37,789
<i>It's 1960. We don't live in a shtetl.</i>

581
00:35:37,901 --> 00:35:39,027
We can marry for love.

582
00:35:39,135 --> 00:35:42,002
I'm not sure people do that anymore.

583
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,596
<i>Why do you always have to be so cynical?</i>

584
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:50,879
Because sometimes...
things come...

585
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,038
good things...

586
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:53,775
but there's no future in them.

587
00:35:53,883 --> 00:35:55,180
<i>You're a modern woman, Rach.</i>

588
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:57,014
<i>Forget the wedding.</i>

589
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,146
Believe me, I'd do anything
for some romance right now.

590
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:11,091
Peggy.

591
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,691
Hi, Joan.

592
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:17,236
Mr. Rumsen would like you
to put your industrious little mind

593
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,865
towards coming up with copy
for Belle Jolie Lipsticks.

594
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:22,843
I don't understand.

595
00:36:22,946 --> 00:36:24,345
They want me to write something?

596
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:26,210
Whatever you said
in that brainstorming session

597
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:28,341
apparently knocked their socks off.

598
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:31,454
Oh, my gosh.

599
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:32,885
I don't know what to say.

600
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:35,457
You will, of course,
continue to cover Mr. Draper's desk.

601
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:38,186
Any writing you do
will be on your own time.

602
00:36:38,294 --> 00:36:39,386
Do I get a raise?

603
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:40,588
No.

604
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:41,629
Congratulations.

605
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:44,723
More work and more responsibility.

606
00:36:44,834 --> 00:36:47,632
I guess you'll be entitled
to some dinner money.

607
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,398
That's swell.

608
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:50,996
Maybe I should go and thank them?

609
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,709
I'm not really dressed.
Tomorrow, maybe?

610
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:56,904
No need.
They wanted me to tell you.

611
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:58,537
They were very specific about it.

612
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:03,479
Well, you know what they say:
The medium is the message.

613
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:24,028
And here I was just wishing for a man
to help me with my yard work.

614
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:33,915
Sorry.

615
00:37:34,017 --> 00:37:37,111
That's what I get for being domestic.

616
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,620
Let's get this off.

617
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:45,291
Oh, God, hold that.

618
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:46,692
The thought.

619
00:37:58,975 --> 00:37:59,999
Hi, Roy.

620
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:01,599
Hi, beautiful.

621
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:04,907
What's shakin'?

622
00:38:09,052 --> 00:38:10,917
Busy dance card, huh?

623
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,955
Uh, Roy, this is my friend Don Draper.

624
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:16,287
Don, this is Roy Hazellit.

625
00:38:16,392 --> 00:38:17,381
Pleasure.

626
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:20,427
Lan's playing down at the Gaslight.

627
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,088
We're gonna go support him,
pass the basket.

628
00:38:22,198 --> 00:38:24,166
You in?

629
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:25,996
That is if Dad will let you out.

630
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:27,399
Sounds like fun.

631
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:29,494
Don, we should go down for a while.

632
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:31,335
Come on. It'll be a kick.
What do you say?

633
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,306
Afraid you'll miss the 5:31?

634
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:37,209
I think I'm gonna stay here.

635
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:47,646
I'll wear a skirt and nothing else.

636
00:38:54,364 --> 00:38:55,729
What took you so long?

637
00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:58,494
One of the media buyers
ambushed me in the elevator

638
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,069
with tickets to the ballet, of all things.

639
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,535
I told him I had plans,

640
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,573
but he insisted we share
a cab across town anyways.

641
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:05,673
I couldn't shake him.

642
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:06,673
Which one was it?

643
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:09,836
George Asbury. He's a hound.

644
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:13,109
It doesn't matter.
They're all just boys.

645
00:39:13,216 --> 00:39:15,207
Poor bastard probably
couldn't help himself,

646
00:39:15,318 --> 00:39:19,379
the way you glide around that office
like some magnificent ship.

647
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:23,458
Well, I don't want to be a distraction.

648
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,620
Shall I, um, order horse blinders
for the rest of the office?

649
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:34,267
You didn't.

650
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,201
Oh, I sure did.

651
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:45,679
Well, what am I supposed to do with it?

652
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:49,115
The store lady said you can do anything
but put the cage on the radiator.

653
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:51,277
You're terrible.

654
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:53,821
Well, you can't blame a man for trying.

655
00:39:53,923 --> 00:39:56,949
I just hate the thought
of having to share you.

656
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:01,626
You don't have to share me now.

657
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:10,195
Joanie, you smell so good.

658
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:12,797
I've been thinking about this all day.

659
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:17,903
Mona is looking at a weekend
in Old Saybrook with the in-laws.

660
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:20,676
There's not enough liquor in the world.

661
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,485
Roger.

662
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,059
Sorry.

663
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:45,970
"Mary Katharine Cahill,

664
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:48,407
"a daughter of Harriet M. Barr

665
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:51,571
"and Archibald W. Barr
of Stonington, Connecticut,

666
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,808
"and Kevin Mark Duncan III,

667
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,907
"a son of Beatrice Hoslinger

668
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:58,919
"and Kevin Mark Duncan, Jr.,
of Manhattan,

"were married last evening

at the Episcopal Church
of the Heavenly Rest. "

671
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,358
He travels around the country

672
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,894
and collects miniature
replicas of monuments...

673
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,624
Washington Memorial,
Bunker Hill, Mount Rushmore...

674
00:41:09,732 --> 00:41:12,166
and then he sticks them up his ass.

675
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:14,168
Symbolism intended.

676
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,034
No place to put your coat.

677
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,170
Switch seats with me.

678
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:23,472
No way.

679
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:25,137
Can we get a round over here?

680
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,909
Jack Daniels, Duchess.

681
00:41:27,016 --> 00:41:29,109
Sounds like a great idea.

682
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:31,584
Anyway, turns out this Spanish cat and I

683
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:34,349
<i>are mucho simpatico
with the direction we talked about going.</i>

684
00:41:34,457 --> 00:41:35,981
With the "Theater of the People" thing?

685
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,024
Conscious drama.

686
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:39,151
Not the soulless bullshit

687
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,059
kept alive by the middle class

688
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:43,792
with their season tickets
to Dick Van Dyke and Mary Martin.

689
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,731
I bet Don here can tell you firsthand.

690
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:47,598
Broadway is the birthplace
of mediocrity.

691
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:50,263
"The groom wore a matching boutonniêre
of sweetheart roses. "

692
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,034
Well, maybe it's born there,

693
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:54,769
but I think it may be conceived right here.

694
00:41:54,877 --> 00:41:56,208
"The couple will
honeymoon in Jamaica,

695
00:41:56,312 --> 00:41:58,746
and take up residence in Rye, New York. "

696
00:42:09,392 --> 00:42:11,383
Thank you, Don.

697
00:42:11,494 --> 00:42:12,961
<i>L'chaim.</i>

698
00:42:14,263 --> 00:42:16,356
So what do you do, Don?

699
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:17,898
I blow up bridges.

700
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,662
Don's in advertising.

701
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,896
No way.

702
00:42:22,004 --> 00:42:24,370
Madison Avenue? What a gas.

703
00:42:24,473 --> 00:42:26,168
We all have to serve somebody.

704
00:42:28,244 --> 00:42:30,075
Perpetuating the lie.

705
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:31,510
How do you sleep at night?

706
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:33,377
On a bed made of money.

707
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:36,451
Isn't this an education?

708
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:41,216
You hucksters in your tower created
the religion of mass consumption.

709
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:46,626
People want to be told what to do so badly
that they'll listen to anyone.

710
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:48,196
When you say people,

711
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,390
I have a feeling you're
talking about thou.

712
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:52,262
And I have a feeling

713
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:55,531
that you spent more time
on your hair this morning than she did.

714
00:42:55,638 --> 00:42:59,074
You two want to head
to the urinals and poke it out?

715
00:43:01,677 --> 00:43:02,871
So, Roy,

716
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:05,641
if you had a job...

717
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:07,340
what would you do?

718
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,419
I'm starting a theater,
right here in the Village.

719
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:11,850
It's a cooperative.

720
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:14,616
Midge is going to get in there,
paint some flats.

721
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:16,885
I said I'd think about it.

722
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:20,019
Last night I dreamed

723
00:43:20,129 --> 00:43:25,692
of making love to Fidel Castro
in a king-size bed

724
00:43:25,801 --> 00:43:28,827
at the Waldorf-Astoria.

725
00:43:28,938 --> 00:43:32,806
<i>"¡Viva la revoluciónl" he roared,</i>

726
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:35,707
as he vanquished my dress.

727
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:37,676
Outside the window,

728
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,578
Nikita Khrushchev watched us,

729
00:43:40,683 --> 00:43:42,878
plucking a chicken.

730
00:43:45,955 --> 00:43:47,923
Take off your shirt!

731
00:43:48,024 --> 00:43:49,514
Take your shirt off!

732
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:58,028
I should go.

733
00:43:58,134 --> 00:43:59,601
Too much art for me.

734
00:43:59,702 --> 00:44:00,691
Stay.

735
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:02,566
This is Ian.

736
00:44:04,573 --> 00:44:06,939
We'll go right afterwards.

737
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,351
By the waters

738
00:44:21,457 --> 00:44:25,985
The waters of Babylon

739
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:29,690
We lay down and wept

740
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:32,267
And wept

741
00:44:32,368 --> 00:44:35,132
For thee, Zion

742
00:44:35,237 --> 00:44:38,206
We remember thee

743
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:40,366
Remember thee

744
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:43,934
Remember thee, Zion

745
00:44:44,046 --> 00:44:47,812
By the waters

746
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:52,820
The waters of Babylon

747
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:56,619
- We lay down and wept
- By the waters

748
00:44:56,726 --> 00:44:58,717
- And wept
- The waters

749
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:01,729
- For thee, Zion
- Of Babylon

750
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,629
- We remember thee
- By the waters

751
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:06,998
- Remember thee
- The waters

752
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:10,561
- Remember thee, Zion
- Of Babylon

753
00:45:10,673 --> 00:45:13,665
- We remember thee
- We lay down and wept

754
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:15,869
- Remember thee
- And wept

755
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:19,379
- Remember thee, Zion
- For thee, Zion

756
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:23,282
- By the waters
- We lay down and wept

757
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:25,513
- The waters
- And wept

758
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:28,146
- Of Babylon
- For thee, Zion

759
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:31,988
- We lay down and wept
- By the waters

760
00:45:32,094 --> 00:45:34,187
- And wept
- The waters

761
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:37,129
- For thee, Zion
- Of Babylon

762
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:40,168
- We remember thee
- By the waters

763
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:42,328
- Remember thee
- The waters

764
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:45,965
- Remember thee, Zion
- Of Babylon
