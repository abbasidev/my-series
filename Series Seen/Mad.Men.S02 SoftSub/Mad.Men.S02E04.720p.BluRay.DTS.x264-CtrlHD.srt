1
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,631
But when the flesh
lusts against the spirit

2
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,728
and the spirit against the flesh,

3
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:48,775
the rational soul is supported
by the cross of Christ.

4
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:52,869
Nor does it, when seduced
by evil desires,

5
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,845
consent to evil doings,

6
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:58,350
for it is pierced
by the nails of continence

7
00:00:58,452 --> 00:00:59,976
and the fear of God.

8
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:03,853
And, as at all times,
we must live worthily,

9
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,859
so at all times we must bear the cross,

10
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,691
which for each one
is rightly called his,

11
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,662
for it is born by each one...

12
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,324
I'm not feeling so good.

13
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,231
That's because you're hung over.

14
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,395
I can smell it.

15
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:18,870
We have supper.

16
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:21,032
She's been fasting all day.
I need your help.

17
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:23,500
And as a rule,

18
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,340
there is a greater danger
in the hidden betrayer

19
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:27,038
than in the open foe.

20
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:32,377
Is there a draft? I'll close it.

21
00:01:32,486 --> 00:01:34,147
No, Father.

22
00:01:34,255 --> 00:01:35,916
Are you with one of these two?

23
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:39,015
No.

24
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:41,759
Okay, turn around.

25
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:45,197
If you see me again
and I'm not smiling,

26
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,766
I don't think you're gonna like it.

27
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:49,432
Now get back in there.

28
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,844
Are you leaving?

29
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:00,675
Just to get some air.

30
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,772
You don't have to be polite.

31
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:06,375
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to lie to you in here.

32
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:07,613
I'm Father Gill.

33
00:02:07,721 --> 00:02:08,619
I'm Peggy Olson.

34
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:10,713
- Katherine Olson's girl.
- Yes.

35
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:12,520
Yes, I'm having dinner at your sister's.

36
00:02:12,626 --> 00:02:14,617
Are you a new priest?

37
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:16,821
I'm visiting.

38
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:21,126
So are you gonna come back in?

39
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:23,136
Yes.

40
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:40,120
Hello.

41
00:02:42,223 --> 00:02:44,020
Good morning, Caroline.

42
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:47,157
Yes.

43
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:49,559
We're up.

44
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:52,188
Barbecue.

45
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:53,698
Right.

46
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:55,928
Caroline, we went over this.

47
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:57,333
Steaks.

48
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,133
And the kids can eat hot dogs.

49
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:01,732
Cancel.

50
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,309
I'm sorry. What?

51
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:07,581
I don't know.

52
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,706
Jell-O?

53
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:12,285
Do you want me to pick
something else up?

54
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:14,354
Cancel.

55
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:16,650
Caroline, hold on a sec.

56
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:18,452
I can't.

57
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:30,392
Caroline, I feel terrible about this,
but Don's not feeling well.

58
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:33,371
No. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,509
The 22nd?

60
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:38,512
Isn't that Easter?

61
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,077
Good.

62
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,739
Bye-bye.

63
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:46,720
What's with you?

64
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,516
I don't know.

65
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:51,454
I had an amazing dream.

66
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:02,765
You're always hogging the TV!

67
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,132
I don't like baby stuff.

68
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:06,638
Get out. We're... sleeping.

69
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,708
Get some Raisin Bran.

70
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:10,868
You can eat it in the den.

71
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,775
Out!

72
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,347
Out!

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,745
I should have locked the door.

74
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,172
Here's number 2, sir.

75
00:04:43,277 --> 00:04:44,471
Thank you, Jeeves.

76
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,376
Why are we in the living room?

77
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:50,347
Because we live here.

78
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:56,888
What did I say about the stereo?

79
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,925
I wasn't touching it.

80
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:02,929
Bobby, I saw you do it.

81
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,555
- I didn't do it.
- Go watch TV, both of you.

82
00:05:14,174 --> 00:05:16,142
I love this song.

83
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,872
His voice is like silk,

84
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,607
and you can really hear the words.

85
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,745
He makes everything
sound like Christmas.

86
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:31,619
In high school, I used to
love dancing to this song.

87
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:34,853
Come dance with me.

88
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:37,226
I thought we weren't
doing anything today.

89
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,764
Hurry. It's almost over.

90
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,107
I hate to think about your
reputation in high school.

91
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,982
Are you going to sit at the table?

92
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:08,260
Gerry, could you get it?

93
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:09,727
Jesus, Anita, I can't move.

94
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,092
Watch your language!

95
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:12,927
And I don't care if you have to lay there.

96
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,263
- Put your shoes on!
- Little Gerry, get my shoes!

97
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:16,927
Do you want me to get the door?

98
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,868
I can't reach my toes.
What am I supposed to do?

99
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:25,739
Hello, Father.

100
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:27,313
You're not leaving, are you?

101
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:30,076
Hello, Father. I'm sorry I'm late.

102
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:33,415
I went by Green-Wood to visit my son.

103
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,852
Well, I would love to meet him.

104
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:38,117
It's a cemetery.

105
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:40,250
Father, welcome.

106
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,625
Come, before it gets cold.

107
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,323
Hello, Father.

108
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:47,297
I'm sorry I missed Mass. My back is out.

109
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:49,733
He hasn't been feeling well,
but he did his part.

110
00:06:49,837 --> 00:06:51,236
He watched the baby.

111
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:53,772
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

112
00:06:53,874 --> 00:06:55,364
We all do.

113
00:06:55,476 --> 00:06:57,273
I'm sorry. I gotta lay down.

114
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:59,368
Oh, please, please.

115
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:02,105
Oh, come.

116
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:03,478
Of course, Father.

117
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:04,710
Right this way.

118
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:06,809
We have you here.

119
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,014
Gerard! Mikey! Wash your hands!

120
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:12,854
They've disappeared.

121
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,928
Don't wait for them.

122
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:20,889
Father, would you
honor us and say grace?

123
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,468
Certainly. Why not?

124
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:27,464
O Lord, thank you
for this wonderful feast.

125
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:28,973
Thank you for these people

126
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:32,671
and this parish and their home.

127
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:37,480
That was beautiful.

128
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:39,449
Are you gonna say grace now?

129
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:45,286
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts

130
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:47,053
we are about to receive from thy bounty,

131
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:49,823
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

132
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,124
Through Christ our Lord.

133
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:52,892
Amen.

134
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,861
Okay.

135
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,681
Monsignor says you have
a beautiful singing voice.

136
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,216
And you play the harmonica?

137
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:12,683
The guitar.

138
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,617
I actually learned
how to play the mandolin

139
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,710
when I was in Rome.

140
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:16,755
And soccer.

141
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:18,791
Did you meet the Holy Father?

142
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:20,052
Not exactly.

143
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,991
It's kind of like being in Washington

144
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:24,563
and asking if you've met the president.

145
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:26,223
But you know
when he's in the building.

146
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:30,495
Aren't you gonna have one?

147
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:31,798
Should I?

148
00:08:31,905 --> 00:08:33,930
Well, I'm not gonna drink by myself.

149
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,032
I'll get the sherry.

150
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:37,303
I'll get it, Ma.

151
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:39,641
I've always wanted to go to Rome.

152
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:42,738
Ah, yes, well,
Vatican City is one thing,

153
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,047
but then you realize you're in Italy.

154
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:47,586
Peggy works in Manhattan.

155
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:49,519
Oh, really?

156
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:50,590
What do you do, Peggy?

157
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:52,420
She works on Madison Avenue.

158
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:55,222
She comes up with the words
in advertisements.

159
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,820
They call it copywriting, Ma.

160
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:59,159
Father, I'm glad you're here.

161
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:00,893
I didn't know they knew what I did.

162
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:03,401
Stop it. No, you should see her work.

163
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:06,495
Lipstick, reducing programs,
feminine products.

164
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:08,507
Mom, not in front of Father.

165
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:10,907
She used to do her presentations for us.

166
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,137
She uses Latin.

167
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:17,082
I'm sorry to do this,
but I really should go.

168
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:18,344
Look at that.

169
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:20,113
Well, where are you headed?

170
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,744
I'll give you a lift. I have a car.

171
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:25,256
- To the Fourth Avenue BMT.
- Okay.

172
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:27,793
It is such an honor
to have you in our house.

173
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:29,658
And I'm sorry the chicken
was overcooked.

174
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:32,231
The chicken was perfect,
and you know that.

175
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,458
Go get the Brownie.

176
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,160
Let me wrap up some cake.

177
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,103
Thank you, but no, thank you, Anita.

178
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:41,470
You've all really made me homesick.

179
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,839
Father, would you mind?

180
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,217
Say "cheese."

181
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,311
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

182
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:08,357
Brooks, have you made any decision
about our immediate future?

183
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:09,560
Believe it or not, Daddy,

184
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,071
Brooks has other interests
besides drinking.

185
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,038
That'll change.

186
00:10:15,142 --> 00:10:16,666
Would you stop scaring them?

187
00:10:16,777 --> 00:10:18,608
We're not scared.

188
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:20,475
Then how is it you've been engaged
for two months

189
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,207
and you're not running around
making wedding plans?

190
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:24,147
Because I told you.

191
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:26,845
We don't like the idea
of having a big wedding.

192
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:29,149
It doesn't have to be big.

193
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:30,188
We think it's silly.

194
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,487
You have to invite a bunch of strangers
to gawk at us

195
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:36,391
to somehow prove
our feelings for each other.

196
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:39,465
You know, it's embarrassing.

197
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:43,826
Brooks?

198
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:46,504
Whatever she wants.

199
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:50,208
Well, your mother wants a wedding.

200
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:52,573
Mommy had a wedding.

201
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,146
I did.

202
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:55,509
Wearing that dress,

203
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,642
my sister and my mother
fussing over me.

204
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:02,051
It was the best I ever looked in my life.

205
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:03,383
The Pierre.

206
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,223
I was drunk, and I didn't
have a glass of champagne.

207
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:11,764
Gliding around in your father's arms.

208
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:14,891
You know how good a dancer he is.

209
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:17,129
Dancing with Grandpa.

210
00:11:17,237 --> 00:11:18,932
I don't want you to miss that.

211
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:29,412
What are you getting?

212
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:32,144
I'll have the mussels
with garlic if you do.

213
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,950
That's sweet.

214
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:45,458
Thank you for the ride, Father.

215
00:11:45,565 --> 00:11:46,759
Peggy, wait.

216
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:48,630
Yes?

217
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:54,802
I want to ask you about something,
and it's personal.

218
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,009
Okay.

219
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:04,447
I have the honor of delivering
the sermon next Sunday.

220
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:06,542
It's Palm Sunday. That's a biggie.

221
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,644
I mean, you're on deck for Easter.

222
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:11,280
And, well...

223
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,019
you said you did presentations.

224
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:16,721
Can I run some things past you?

225
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,630
I don't know what I could tell you.

226
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,293
You must do this all the time.

227
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,495
Well, I've done it,

228
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,299
but your monsignor
is a tough act to follow.

229
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,706
I don't know that I'm your audience.

230
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:33,746
You were leaving,

231
00:12:33,847 --> 00:12:36,680
and we ended up
having supper together,

232
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:38,842
and you're the only
person in this parish

233
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:40,385
that knows about public speaking.

234
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:42,045
This is how God works.

235
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,624
I find that if I'm prepared

236
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:51,993
and I have confidence
in what I'm selling,

237
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,657
that kills the butterflies.

238
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,428
That's good.

239
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,025
I'm prepared.

240
00:12:57,137 --> 00:12:58,764
Do you have any other tips?

241
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,208
Well, pick somebody
and make eye contact with them.

242
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:09,214
You'd think it would make you nervous,
but it really focuses you.

243
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,081
Don't they have stuff that
you're supposed to talk about?

244
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,657
Yes, they have stuff.

245
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:23,491
Let's just say I'm covered
in the content department.

246
00:13:24,698 --> 00:13:26,859
I can only speak for myself,

247
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:30,528
but the sermon is the only part of Mass
that's in English,

248
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:33,765
and it's very hard to tell sometimes.

249
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:36,468
Maybe be simpler?

250
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:39,340
Give us a chance of understanding.

251
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:42,842
Thank you for the ride.

252
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,883
I should go. I really do have to work.

253
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:46,885
Idle hands.

254
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:48,454
It's good to know you.

255
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:50,318
Have a great week.

256
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:16,777
I hate my feet.

257
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:19,181
I love your feet, Mommy.

258
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:21,379
Feet? I thought those were water skis.

259
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,351
Stop it.

260
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:26,448
Stop it! Stop it!

261
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,527
Stop it!

262
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:32,055
Great.

263
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,632
You broke it.

264
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,758
I didn't mean to.

265
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:38,235
You're being wild in the house.

266
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:39,396
It's late.

267
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:41,565
Everybody, brush your teeth
and go to bed.

268
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,336
I'm hungry.

269
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:44,671
You're going to bed.

270
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:47,008
We didn't have any dinner.

271
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:52,645
It's 7:30.

272
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,850
Okay. Come downstairs.

273
00:14:55,956 --> 00:14:57,389
I'll make you some grilled cheese.

274
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,458
Go.

275
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:01,925
- Go. Go. Go.
- Come on.

276
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,865
And my wife says, "Duck and cover."

277
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,441
Well, look at this.

278
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,884
Marty, meet Vicky.

279
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:30,183
Hello, Marty.

280
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,418
- Hello.
- I've heard so much about you.

281
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:36,051
But you didn't tell me
about his wonderful head.

282
00:15:36,162 --> 00:15:37,424
What about it?

283
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,896
Someone thinks a lot.

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,127
Well, look at that. It's love at first rub.

285
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:45,204
My head has been known
to make wishes come true.

286
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:48,568
Don't get up.

287
00:15:48,675 --> 00:15:50,666
This is Marty Hasselbach,
from Gorton's.

288
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:52,677
Nice to meet you. Roger Sterling.

289
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,178
We were due to meet
tomorrow anyway.

290
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:56,340
- Love that frozen scrod.
- Thank you.

291
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:58,576
I'm Vicky, Marty's wife.

292
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:03,347
Aren't you a lucky man.

293
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:05,617
Yes, I am.

294
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:08,159
We were just discussing the male head.

295
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:10,194
Is that right?

296
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:12,697
I like the Yul Brynner look.

297
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,391
She does seem to.

298
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,799
I keep threatening
to shave him one morning.

299
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:19,269
Just hop in the shower
and take it all off.

300
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:21,237
Is that right?

301
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:22,603
How long have you two been married?

302
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:24,768
Five years.

303
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,910
Second time around. That explains it.

304
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:31,580
It's nice to meet you.

305
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:33,312
I hope to see you both tomorrow.

306
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,150
A pleasure.

307
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:45,459
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett
is here at my desk.

308
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,832
No. Of course. Send her in.

309
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:56,005
Mrs. Barrett.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

310
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:57,007
May I take your coat?

311
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,338
No, thank you.

312
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,277
I'm not sure how they
do it in show business,

313
00:17:03,383 --> 00:17:04,748
but around here
we have this nifty gadget

314
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,478
called an appointment book.

315
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:08,213
I was in the neighborhood.

316
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:10,255
What did Jimmy do now,
ask Eleanor Roosevelt

317
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:12,825
how fast her husband
ran the hundred-yard dash?

318
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:16,026
How are you?

319
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:17,323
Busy.

320
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,834
I have an idea for a television show.

321
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:23,095
Congratulations.

322
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:25,171
Is it too early to have a drink?

323
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,795
Let me call for some ice.

324
00:17:26,906 --> 00:17:28,601
No need.

325
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,176
How do I make this happen?
Where do I go?

326
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:33,439
What is it?

327
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:35,980
Everyone loves Candid Camera, right?

328
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:37,606
Hidden camera situations.

329
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:39,184
Only Jimmy's the host,

330
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:41,310
and he's Jimmy, you know?

331
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:42,388
Not nice.

332
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,887
It's derivative, with a twist.

333
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:48,085
That's what they're looking for.

334
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,025
It's called Grin and Barrett.

335
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,029
That's cute.

336
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:55,033
I thought it up all by myself.

337
00:17:55,135 --> 00:17:56,932
ABC's sick about losing Candid Camera.

338
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,561
But you'd have to get Jimmy
out of his contract with Utz.

339
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:01,799
I thought about that.

340
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:02,897
It's exclusive,

341
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:04,670
but they could come on as sponsors.

342
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:06,473
Show needs a national sponsor.

343
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:07,910
Utz won't do you any good.

344
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:10,642
You're a pessimist.

345
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,217
They could let him out.

346
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:14,149
They should want to keep Jimmy happy.

347
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:15,846
They don't care.

348
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:19,154
But they could be told

349
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,489
that their spots
would have more punch,

350
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:23,027
wherever they air,

351
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:24,926
if Jimmy's on a hit television show.

352
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,360
That is very good advice.

353
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,285
Will you sell the show for me?

354
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:50,513
I'm not interested in doing that.

355
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:54,487
But I can talk to the Schillings.

356
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:01,625
What's this?

357
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:07,334
I was thinking how I could avoid
becoming bored with you.

358
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:17,283
Bobbie. I have work.

359
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:19,442
Bullshit.

360
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:24,419
It's good.

361
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:26,287
But we should sell them
on the mascot first.

362
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:28,417
The jingle's going to be a cutie.

363
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:31,622
Hasselbach's at 3, right?

364
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:32,857
Is he bringing the missus?

365
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:35,534
Mary, that'll be all for now.

366
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:44,399
Roger...

367
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,071
there is a Mrs. Hasselbach,

368
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,238
and that's not her.

369
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:53,147
I see.

370
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:54,777
That makes sense.

371
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:56,685
I've got her number if you want it.

372
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,222
I've got lots of numbers.

373
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,651
No. That's okay.

374
00:20:02,762 --> 00:20:04,525
Keep up the good work.

375
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,857
Daddy!

376
00:20:11,704 --> 00:20:12,728
You need to shave.

377
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,737
You need to shave.

378
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:17,106
Some people weren't so good today.

379
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:20,509
What happened?

380
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,774
Bobby broke the record player.

381
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:24,941
The repair call is going to be $18.

382
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:28,145
9 if you want to put it in your car
and drag it over there.

383
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:30,313
I don't.

384
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:31,515
When I asked him about it,

385
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,353
he said he didn't do it.

386
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:34,448
He lied to my face.

387
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,552
Where is he?

388
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:38,324
In his room.

389
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:42,626
Go on out.

390
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:54,945
Mommy says you broke the hi-fi.

391
00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:56,982
I believe her.

392
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,710
Don't do that again.

393
00:20:58,818 --> 00:21:00,843
I won't.

394
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:12,856
That's it?

395
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,695
I said to him,
"Wait till your father gets home,"

396
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,359
and that's what he gets...
"Go to sleep."

397
00:21:16,469 --> 00:21:17,697
He knows he did something wrong.

398
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:19,465
First the shenanigans
with the washing machine,

399
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,039
and now the record player.

400
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,698
Don, you have to do something.

401
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,242
He needs a spanking.

402
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:26,505
How else is he gonna learn

403
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:27,602
the difference between
right and wrong?

404
00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:28,840
That's not the way it works.

405
00:21:28,948 --> 00:21:30,506
You think you'd be
the man you are today

406
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:32,551
if your father didn't hit you?

407
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,049
Can I get something to eat?

408
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:49,625
You left this by the bed.

409
00:21:49,736 --> 00:21:51,294
I'll do it.

410
00:22:00,146 --> 00:22:01,443
Draper residence.

411
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:03,777
Good. You're there. It's Duck.

412
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:05,441
Sunday morning.
Where else would I be?

413
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,781
Shel Keneally called me late last night.

414
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:08,945
American Airlines already scheduled

415
00:22:09,055 --> 00:22:10,613
a bunch of pitches for this week.

416
00:22:10,723 --> 00:22:12,623
Why are we on the calendar
for two weeks from now?

417
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:13,749
We're not anymore.

418
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,589
I got us Good Friday first thing.

419
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:16,787
Most of the team's already here.

420
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:18,090
The rest are on their way.

421
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:20,666
My hand!

422
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:23,557
Hello?

423
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,659
Let me look.

424
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:26,033
It hurts.

425
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:27,663
I walk out of the room
for ten seconds?

426
00:22:27,774 --> 00:22:29,332
Mommy, make it stop.

427
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:31,535
He needs to go
to the emergency room.

428
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:32,838
That was Duck Phillips on the phone.

429
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:34,310
American Airlines
moved up their presentation.

430
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,314
- So?
- So I have to go in.

431
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,281
Damn it.

432
00:22:38,384 --> 00:22:40,875
One child in the emergency room
is enough to deal with.

433
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:42,113
Take Sally.

434
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:44,189
Send Sally to Francine's.

435
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,518
It's Palm Sunday.

436
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,684
I am not about to impose
on Francine today.

437
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:52,557
I want to go with Daddy.

438
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:14,883
Hello, Father Gill.

439
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:16,079
Come in.

440
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:19,181
- Come in.
- Father, welcome.

441
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,623
I'm terribly sorry, Anita, Ms. Olson.

442
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:21,887
I can't stay.

443
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:23,859
- Oh, no.
- Oh, that's terrible.

444
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:25,897
We have Tom, Roberta Callahan,

445
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:27,693
Mrs. O'Neill, Mrs. Casey.

446
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,928
Yes, I'm afraid Mrs. Marchetti
has taken a turn for the worse.

447
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:32,197
I hope you'll forgive me.

448
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:33,363
Oh, that poor woman.

449
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:35,464
Let me fix you a paper plate.

450
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:36,803
Peggy didn't make it?

451
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:38,171
Oh, she's sick.

452
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:41,144
Oh. Well, could you give her this?

453
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:42,942
It is a copy of my sermon.

454
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:44,038
She helped me quite a bit,

455
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,708
and I would love for her to see it.

456
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:48,252
Peggy helped you write something?

457
00:23:48,354 --> 00:23:49,753
Just some tips, really.

458
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:51,346
It was very good.

459
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:53,925
I felt like I was the only one
you were talking to.

460
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:55,220
Well, thank you.

461
00:23:55,328 --> 00:23:56,386
Again, I'm sorry.

462
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:06,171
It's so nice he's taken an interest in her.

463
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,000
Come, let's eat.

464
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:28,689
Mr. Phillips and the others
are in the conference room.

465
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:30,888
I see you've brought a little helper.

466
00:24:30,997 --> 00:24:33,295
Betty had her hands full today.

467
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:36,095
Sally, be good for Miss Holloway.

468
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:38,432
Keep her away from the paper cutter.

469
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:46,503
Friday morning,
the American Airlines folks

470
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:47,738
will join us at 10.

471
00:24:47,847 --> 00:24:49,337
Roger will handle the introductions.

472
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:50,847
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Sterling,

473
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,611
Creative to the right,
Accounts to the left,

474
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:55,414
starting with myself, then the American
Airlines people, then Campbell.

475
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:58,547
Pete, you're next to our man Shel Keneally.

476
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:00,091
There will be one for each of them.

477
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:02,593
We can't get cordovan by Friday,
so we're going with maroon.

478
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:03,889
Campbell will run the show.

479
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:06,157
He has a list of every ad
we need in the presentation.

480
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:07,357
Art Department needs to make sure

481
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:10,867
that every image we use in a comp
is an airplane that American has.

482
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,733
No cutting and pasting
planes from other ads.

483
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,363
They may all look alike to us, but...

484
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,735
Why are you here?

485
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:19,835
I'm head of the Television Department.

486
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:22,412
We have 90 minutes to present.

487
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:23,675
I'll do the setup...

488
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:25,250
the history of American Airlines

489
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:26,648
up to and including the crash.

490
00:25:26,752 --> 00:25:28,242
I'll tee up Creative
with what research says

491
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:29,651
travelers are waiting
to hear from American.

492
00:25:29,755 --> 00:25:32,622
And then, Don, you do what you do.

493
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:34,784
Maybe you could give us a little peek.

494
00:25:35,995 --> 00:25:37,656
I'm not ready to do that yet.

495
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,499
I say we show all three campaigns,

496
00:25:44,604 --> 00:25:46,128
eliminate all possible objections.

497
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:48,230
Something for everybody.

498
00:25:48,341 --> 00:25:51,242
Remember, this isn't the work
we have to run in the end.

499
00:25:51,344 --> 00:25:53,005
This is about winning these guys over.

500
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:55,771
Creative.

501
00:25:56,949 --> 00:25:57,938
In my office.

502
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,288
You have big ones.

503
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:05,857
My mommy has big ones, too.

504
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,324
And I'm gonna have
big ones when I grow up.

505
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:19,370
I don't care if we're
just selling a point of view,

506
00:26:19,472 --> 00:26:20,871
but we have to commit to one thing.

507
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:22,770
They don't like wiggle room.

508
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:25,036
They like to see us
blowing up bridges behind us.

509
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:29,010
These are the boards
for the 60-second television spots.

510
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:30,309
Music you can talk over.

511
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:32,740
Stewardesses.

512
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:34,319
We're gonna bookend every spot

513
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,012
with the plane taking off and landing

514
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:37,612
up, down, no problems,

515
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:41,716
everything okay, every commercial.

516
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:47,894
Where's that list
Duck's buddy Shel gave us

517
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,934
with all the things that
make American different?

518
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:52,461
What's that?

519
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:57,205
The ad you asked for
to recruit stewardesses.

520
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:00,501
It equates what should
be a glamorous job

521
00:27:00,613 --> 00:27:02,945
with being a waitress in a tin can.

522
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:04,880
Where's the bar of soap,
the ticket sleeves?

523
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:06,349
Who's doing the in-flight menu?

524
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:09,853
I think it's the best menu I've ever written.

525
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:12,356
This is in French.
How do I know it's right?

526
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,982
It's right.

527
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:16,028
Make up a chef.

528
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:18,221
Peggy, did you pick out
a china pattern yet?

529
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:19,923
Did you find the one
from the Queen Mary?

530
00:27:20,032 --> 00:27:23,866
Yes. But there needs to be a decision
if we're doing anything to the logo.

531
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:26,870
I don't know.

532
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,338
We got a lot of bricks,

533
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:32,775
but I don't know
what the building looks like.

534
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:55,826
So how are you, Vicky?

535
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,596
I'm in a very good mood.

536
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,669
Well, I hate to sound remedial,

537
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:06,836
but I haven't done this
since I was in the Navy.

538
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,436
Been with a girl?

539
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:10,742
No. Not that.

540
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,112
Don't worry.

541
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:14,914
The prices may have changed,
but the menu's still the same.

542
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:18,479
Well, your invoice ran across my desk.

543
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:33,737
Look at you.

544
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:42,038
The menu hasn't changed.

545
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,982
Is it open for negotiation?

546
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:50,078
I don't want to ruin the magic.

547
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:53,352
How about double... plus carfare?

548
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:56,019
And I'll assume you live far away.

549
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:58,892
That'll be $100.

550
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:01,762
But I want everything I want.

551
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:06,833
Isn't that the perfect thing to say?

552
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:22,183
That's not so bad, is it?

553
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:27,982
I have to warn you,
I'm not in great health.

554
00:29:28,094 --> 00:29:30,119
Don't believe what they say.

555
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:37,397
No one dies doing this.

556
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:42,870
Are you resting?

557
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:45,102
Everybody's resting.

558
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:48,237
No. I'm thinking.

559
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:50,042
Let's have a conversation.

560
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,147
Is that your maid?

561
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,916
No. She's my girlfriend.

562
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:01,424
Do you kiss her?

563
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:03,518
Sometimes.

564
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:06,223
Do you lay on top of her?

565
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,331
You know what, Sally?

566
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:12,734
Your daddy's gonna be angry
if I don't do my work.

567
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:15,173
Okay.

568
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:25,776
Just a minute, girls.
It's almost your turn.

569
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,822
You know, we'll get to go
anywhere American flies.

570
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:35,393
Familiarization.

571
00:30:35,494 --> 00:30:36,825
We'll have to rent another floor.

572
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:38,260
We'll all have our own offices.

573
00:30:38,364 --> 00:30:42,664
Do you realize we will get to pick out
the stewardesses?

574
00:30:42,768 --> 00:30:43,894
Okay.

575
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:48,936
Son of a bitch.

576
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:52,067
Stupid little...

577
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,304
You there.

578
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,145
Chewing your cud.

579
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:02,243
It's one thing to be unladylike.

580
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:06,882
It's another to treat our office
like a subway platform.

581
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:09,483
Pack up your Wrigley's and go home.

582
00:31:11,697 --> 00:31:14,632
How could it be my gum?
My gum's in my mouth.

583
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:18,469
This place is a zoo.

584
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:21,335
Thank you for getting him
out of here for the day.

585
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,305
Lose the gum, then get
yourself some dinner.

586
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:25,434
He won't remember firing you.

587
00:31:38,224 --> 00:31:41,489
American Airlines is not about the past
any more than America is.

588
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:46,788
Ask not about Cuba.
Ask not about the bomb.

589
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:48,457
We're going to the moon.

590
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:50,194
Throw everything out.

591
00:31:50,302 --> 00:31:51,894
Everything?

592
00:31:52,004 --> 00:31:54,598
There is no such thing
as American history,

593
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:55,765
only a frontier.

594
00:31:57,476 --> 00:32:00,172
That crash happened
to somebody else.

595
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:02,144
It's not about apologies
for what happened.

596
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:04,614
It's about those seven men
in the room on Friday

597
00:32:04,717 --> 00:32:07,151
and what airline they are
going to be running.

598
00:32:07,253 --> 00:32:09,414
So what does that mean?

599
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:12,684
Let's pretend we know
what 1963 looks like.

600
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:26,930
Jesus, Draper, make a decision.

601
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,064
What's that leave us with,
introductions?

602
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:30,505
If I can't mention the crash,

603
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:31,837
there's no preamble at all.

604
00:32:31,944 --> 00:32:32,968
Let it go.

605
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:34,909
Our job is to bend down the branch.

606
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:36,242
Let him pick the fruit.

607
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,095
That champagne
is probably near frozen.

608
00:33:02,174 --> 00:33:03,266
I'm meeting a friend.

609
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,634
You know what I really want?

610
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:09,939
Is there something we left out?

611
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:11,482
Have dinner with me?

612
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:15,548
I told you I'm meeting a friend.

613
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:17,747
I'll pay for his meeting, too.

614
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:21,619
You wouldn't think dinner
would be pushing it on the extras?

615
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:24,389
Have you been to Lutèce yet?

616
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:26,259
I have.

617
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:27,992
I think you'd like it.

618
00:33:29,702 --> 00:33:30,794
I've got it.

619
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,140
It's great, but they're cheeky.

620
00:33:37,242 --> 00:33:40,109
They started with this
prix fixe menu at lunch.

621
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:42,077
8.50 for lunch.

622
00:33:42,181 --> 00:33:44,445
And they have these wines.

623
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,211
What kind of wine do you like?

624
00:33:46,318 --> 00:33:48,650
I don't know. Red?

625
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:51,689
They're going to make you be
more specific than that.

626
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,786
We can walk, if you don't
mind a little rain.

627
00:33:57,896 --> 00:33:59,261
You know what?

628
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:02,357
I love the sound of cabs
whooshing in the water.

629
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:04,903
Shall we?

630
00:34:08,874 --> 00:34:11,274
Isn't this a nice town?

631
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:12,776
Absolutely.

632
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:27,421
She's here on a Sunday,
and I respect that,

633
00:34:27,526 --> 00:34:30,086
but you know she's earning
more than all of us.

634
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:34,263
Come on.

635
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:35,958
Up.

636
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:43,907
Good night, ladies.

637
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:45,601
Thanks for baby-sitting.

638
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:51,544
I'm going home. Be good, Peaches.

639
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:55,951
Your sister wants to talk.

640
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:00,157
Hey, Pegs.

641
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:02,284
Okay.

642
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:03,759
It was good.

643
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:06,228
He gave us a copy
of his sermon to give to you.

644
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,700
Okay. So long.

645
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:13,499
It's nice that he can get to know her
without all her troubles.

646
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:16,335
She's such a beautiful young girl.

647
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:20,503
She does whatever she feels like
with no regard at all.

648
00:35:20,612 --> 00:35:23,706
You're too easy on her.
You know that.

649
00:35:23,816 --> 00:35:25,613
Is Gerry warming up the car?

650
00:36:24,142 --> 00:36:26,838
Shel Keneally was fired this morning.

651
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:30,315
What?

652
00:36:30,415 --> 00:36:33,543
The rest are on their way in.

653
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:34,619
What's going on?

654
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,187
It's over.

655
00:36:36,288 --> 00:36:38,756
So why are they coming in?

656
00:36:38,857 --> 00:36:40,518
Because they have to.

657
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:44,454
And we have to deliver a stillborn baby.

658
00:36:46,064 --> 00:36:49,830
Mr. Phillips, the gentlemen are here
from American Airlines.

659
00:36:49,935 --> 00:36:51,835
Send them in.

660
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:07,917
In the name of the Father, the Son,

661
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,510
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

662
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:12,954
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

663
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:18,052
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

664
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:21,792
I took something
that didn't belong to me.

665
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:24,391
Go on.

666
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:27,335
I was in the Laundromat,

667
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:30,408
and I took some coins off the machine

668
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:31,999
and used them.

669
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:37,639
I took the Lord's name
in vain three times,

670
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:39,148
and...

671
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:45,256
and I am so angry, Father.

672
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:50,428
I am so angry at my little sister.

673
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:55,321
She's causing my mother so much pain.

674
00:37:57,369 --> 00:37:59,803
She had a child out of wedlock.

675
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,807
She seduced a married man.

676
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:04,637
It's a terrible sin,

677
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:07,803
and she acts like it didn't even happen.

678
00:38:10,983 --> 00:38:13,110
And I hate her for it.

679
00:38:15,153 --> 00:38:17,417
And I feel so guilty about it.

680
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:22,083
But everyone keeps
falling all over themselves

681
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:23,821
trying to help her.

682
00:38:25,897 --> 00:38:28,764
And she goes on
like nothing happened.

683
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:31,226
Nothing at all.

684
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:39,672
What about me, Father?

685
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:42,178
My troubles?

686
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,305
What about me being good?

687
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,610
For what?

688
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,743
I understand it's difficult.

689
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:53,052
You know it's not your place to judge.

690
00:38:53,158 --> 00:38:55,956
God sees your goodness.

691
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:58,325
It doesn't feel that way, Father.

692
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,728
Try to trust God on this.

693
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,064
You will get your reward in heaven.

694
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,933
God loves you,

695
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,667
and he knows that you love your sister.

696
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:12,701
I do.

697
00:39:14,112 --> 00:39:17,377
Say three Hail Marys
and two Our Fathers.

698
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:20,417
And try to forgive your sister.

699
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,487
She's not as strong as you are.

700
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:26,982
Would you like to make
your Act of Contrition?

701
00:39:29,695 --> 00:39:31,663
O my God,

702
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:34,561
I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

703
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,294
I detest all my sins

704
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:39,267
because I dread the loss of heaven...

705
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:52,742
Cooper walked them to the elevator.

706
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,443
They acted impressed.

707
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,658
I just can't believe it.

708
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,732
Here. You should have this.

709
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:22,138
No regrets, fellas.

710
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:23,646
We were in it.
That's the important thing.

711
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:25,546
It's heartbreaking.

712
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,414
Still, good work, Don.

713
00:40:35,527 --> 00:40:36,721
Come on.

714
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:39,891
We hired him to bring in new business,

715
00:40:39,998 --> 00:40:41,226
not lose old business.

716
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,200
Don't you love the chase?

717
00:40:46,638 --> 00:40:48,868
Sometimes it doesn't work out.

718
00:40:48,974 --> 00:40:50,202
Those are the stakes.

719
00:40:50,308 --> 00:40:52,401
But when it does work out...

720
00:40:55,881 --> 00:40:58,349
it's like having that first cigarette.

721
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,509
Head gets all dizzy.

722
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:04,521
Your heart pounds, knees go weak.

723
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:06,147
Remember that?

724
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,794
Old business is just old business.

725
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:22,695
You're home early.

726
00:41:22,808 --> 00:41:24,833
It's Good Friday.

727
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:27,343
How did it go?

728
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:29,811
It didn't.

729
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:33,616
Bobby, stop playing with the robot.

730
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,917
Do you want to talk about it?

731
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:42,451
No.

732
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:46,721
How was your day?

733
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:49,801
My father called. He's doing better.

734
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:51,926
He and William played golf yesterday.

735
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:53,732
William made a show of paying for it.

736
00:41:55,173 --> 00:41:57,004
Bobby, what did I just say?

737
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:59,099
It was a accident.

738
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:01,372
You don't listen. Don, do something.

739
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,186
Is that what you wanted?

740
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:17,660
You take no responsibility
for anything that goes on in this house.

741
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:20,356
I pay the bills,
put clothes on your back,

742
00:42:20,465 --> 00:42:21,796
your damn stables.

743
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,424
Don't you dare.

744
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:24,934
I'm here all day.

745
00:42:25,036 --> 00:42:26,401
Alone with them, outnumbered.

746
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:28,165
What about Carla?
Doesn't she count?

747
00:42:28,273 --> 00:42:30,741
It's not her job to raise our children!

748
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:34,334
I'm here, and then you come home
and get to be the hero.

749
00:42:34,446 --> 00:42:35,811
You want me to bring home

750
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:37,404
what I got at the office today?

751
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:38,982
I'll put you through that window.

752
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:49,824
Brush your teeth. It's bedtime.

753
00:43:05,143 --> 00:43:06,474
Bobby, it's not a good time.

754
00:43:06,578 --> 00:43:08,205
I'm sorry.

755
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:11,743
It's okay.

756
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:15,944
Dads get mad sometimes.

757
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:19,447
Did your daddy get mad?

758
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:21,823
He did.

759
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:25,895
What did your daddy look like?

760
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:29,533
Like me.

761
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:30,862
But bigger.

762
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:34,502
What did he like to eat?

763
00:43:38,977 --> 00:43:40,035
Ham.

764
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:44,942
And this candy.

765
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,018
It tasted like violets.

766
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,285
Had a beautiful purple
and silver package.

767
00:43:55,794 --> 00:43:57,284
What did he do?

768
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,062
I told you. He was a farmer.

769
00:44:03,301 --> 00:44:05,269
But he died.

770
00:44:07,372 --> 00:44:08,839
A long time ago.

771
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:14,839
We have to get you a new daddy.

772
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:19,708
Come here.

773
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:54,142
You have nothing to say?

774
00:44:56,855 --> 00:44:58,516
What do you want to hear?

775
00:45:00,225 --> 00:45:01,522
Something.

776
00:45:01,626 --> 00:45:03,116
Anything.

777
00:45:03,228 --> 00:45:06,891
How about you're going
to help raise these children,

778
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:08,295
not be one?

779
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,129
Bets,

780
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:11,896
you do whatever you want.

781
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:14,597
It's not about what I do.

782
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:19,377
He's a little kid.

783
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,146
My father beat
the hell out of me.

784
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:27,912
All it did was
make me fantasize

785
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:30,351
about the day
I could murder him.

786
00:45:35,093 --> 00:45:37,152
I didn't know that.

787
00:45:37,262 --> 00:45:40,231
And I wasn't half
as good as Bobby.

788
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:29,511
Happy Easter, Peggy.

789
00:46:29,614 --> 00:46:31,275
Hello, Father.

790
00:46:31,382 --> 00:46:33,646
I read your sermon. I liked it.

791
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:35,048
It was very colloquial.

792
00:46:35,153 --> 00:46:37,621
You were very helpful.

793
00:46:45,163 --> 00:46:46,960
These kids.

794
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:56,500
For the little one.

795
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:16,452
