1
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,502
Don?

2
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,798
What do you think?

3
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:16,594
Now, it may take a moment to get used to.
I told you, men don't like change.

4
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,306
Well, it's hard for me to judge
when I can't see a price tag.

5
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,850
A modern Chinoiserie breakfront,

6
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,978
a Dunbar, Japanese-influenced sofa,

7
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,482
silk Dupioni drapes, Murano vases,

8
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,235
and a classic Drexel end table.

9
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,614
- And what goes here?
- Where?

10
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,325
Right where we're standing.

11
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:43,412
Well, that's your hearth, darling.
That's the soul of your home.

12
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:47,041
People gather around a fire
even if there isn't one.

13
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,212
- So, Don?
- I think it's fine, Betts.

14
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,340
All you do at work all day
is evaluate objects.

15
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,051
I would like the benefit of your eye.

16
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,935
Move the end table and the lamp
to the other end of the couch.

17
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,943
I think he's right.

18
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,828
- Hot as hell already.
- Yes, it is.

19
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,207
I watched the sunrise today. Couldn't sleep.

20
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,084
- How was it?
- Average.

21
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,796
Ogilvy wrote a book. I got the galleys.

22
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,383
They want a quote or something.

23
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,011
Advertising's already up there with lawyers
as the most reviled.

24
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,138
This is not going to help.

25
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,099
It'll help him.

26
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,727
It's called Confessions of an Ad Man.

27
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,729
- I like the title.
- Please.

28
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,148
It's a book everybody writes,
only he got it published.

29
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,483
It should be called
1,000 Reasons I'm So Great

30
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,069
- Is he publishing it himself?
- No, Atheneum.

31
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,614
I'll send it over. I don't want you to buy it.

32
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,409
I don't know where to put it, and you know
I wouldn't be able to tell you if...

33
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,619
There you are.

34
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,828
When do you want us
to move the meeting to?

35
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,748
- Mr. Draper?
- Move it? I'm 15 minutes late.

36
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,750
I told you I don't want them hovering.

37
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,627
If I'm late, send them away
and call them when I get here.

38
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,671
Mr. Draper, Conrad Hilton is in your office.

39
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,591
- Right now?
- He just walked right in.

40
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:22,053
- We were waiting and he blew right past us.
- Hold on.

41
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,971
Come back in 20 minutes.

42
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,770
- Twenty minutes.
- You can take an hour if you need it.

43
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,189
- He wants to look busy.
- Move it.

44
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,529
Allison, hold all my calls.

45
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,825
Connie. What a great way to start the day.

46
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:50,247
- 9:30? It's practically lunch.
- Well, can I get you something?

47
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:55,378
I've got a personal matter.
It's not fit for the phone.

48
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,972
What can I do for you?

49
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:10,643
I don't know what I'm more disturbed by,
the fact that you don't have a Bible,

50
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,312
or that there's not a single family photo.

51
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,732
- I'm easily distracted.
- You should have those things.

52
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,944
They'll make you feel better
about what you do.

53
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,988
Start showing up on time.

54
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:26,701
Maybe I'm late because I was spending time
with my family reading the Bible.

55
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,539
Are you nervous, Don?
I'm finding you hard to talk to.

56
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:36,502
Well, you caught me by surprise, Connie.
I think you know that.

57
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,595
Now, you're a married man,
so you'll have to use your imagination,

58
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,639
but

59
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,810
I have this involvement.

60
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,648
I can't say it's perfect,
and my needs are being met,

61
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,359
but I have significant needs, Don.

62
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,947
- Do you catch my drift?
- Yes.

63
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,036
So what do I do
when my eye starts to wander?

64
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:17,918
Don't you have a coterie of trusted advisors,
friends, kings,

65
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,296
that might counsel you better?

66
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:26,844
I want you to handle the Waldorf-Astoria,
the New York Hilton and the Statler Hilton.

67
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:31,515
It's just New York,
but my eye has definitely started to wander.

68
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,812
I think that's a good start.

69
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,402
Retainer, etcetera, that's for lawyers.
Everything else will be like this.

70
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,995
Having me in your life
is gonna change things.

71
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,998
- I look forward to it.
- They always say that.

72
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,712
- A happy bunch.
- If you say so.

73
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,673
Young people give us energy.
Don't forget that.

74
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,675
I'll take it from here.

75
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,053
It's not much to start with,

76
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,806
but I look forward
to sharing my dreams with you.

77
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,557
Speak to you soon.

78
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:29,490
I cannot believe you just had a baby
and you redid your house.

79
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,200
Are you suicidal?

80
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,286
They were not
supposed to be simultaneous,

81
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,998
and the baby wasn't the one
that couldn't keep a schedule.

82
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,959
I'm assuming this meeting
means you're interested

83
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,419
in replacing Francine as secretary?

84
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,921
- I am.
- Good.

85
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,508
Because we waited for you
for our most pressing business.

86
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,094
The proposed 3-million-gallon water tank

87
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,555
will not only drain
the Pleasantville Road Reservoir,

88
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,433
but also blemish the natural
and financial health of our community.

89
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:58,060
Well said.

90
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:02,565
The Junior League needs to take over
this effort and explain the issues.

91
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,360
Now, first, conservation. The Silent Spring?

92
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,656
The majestic beauty
of the Hudson River valley.

93
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,869
Second, worthless real estate
on both sides of the river

94
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,747
because some industrial park
on Route 9 needs our water.

95
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,292
We need to go over
the Village Board's head,

96
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:25,171
appeal to the governor.
The Rockefellers own half the land here.

97
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,464
Real estate, that's scary.

98
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,637
I may know someone
in the governor's office.

99
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,389
Who?

100
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,684
His name is Henry.

101
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,353
You're gonna have to do better than that.

102
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,938
Henry Francis.

103
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,067
He's in the paper sometimes,
always right behind Rocky.

104
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,487
- What does he do?
- I'm not really sure.

105
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,034
- How do you know him?
- I met him at a party for Don's work.

106
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,621
Here he is. Oh, my, it just says "Advisor."

107
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,458
Yes, I know who he is.

108
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:07,254
He used to be the Republican Party chair
for Westchester County.

109
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,258
- I know him.
- Well, call him, then.

110
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,137
I think we have a better chance
if Betty calls.

111
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,351
It's not adorable to pretend
like you're not adorable.

112
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,813
Call him. He's a big deal.

113
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,070
Miami is where we should start,
let it grow from there.

114
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,529
Ho-Ho wants it everywhere.

115
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,658
He just bought land in Seattle.
It's an indoor city.

116
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,244
As long as he keeps writing checks.

117
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,037
Look, do you want to
kill this thing in one blow

118
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,289
or do you want to
shear the sheep every year?

119
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,291
Whatever you want, Don.

120
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,713
You made it clear
you don't want to talk about it,

121
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,466
but at least tell us how you know him.

122
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,552
We ran into each other at a party.

123
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,556
That'll be all.

124
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:11,193
I know Roger will be the face of this thing,
but I wouldn't mind doing the legwork.

125
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,070
Pete, I think you're supposed to
bring in the account,

126
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,698
and I'm supposed to beg to be on it.

127
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,617
What happened
with North American Aviation?

128
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,827
It's going well.

129
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,871
My friend Russ,
who deals with McNamara's office

130
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,331
said the orders are through the roof

131
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,960
for helicopters, carbines
and especially jets for Vietnam.

132
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,462
I think I've convinced North American
they're going to need to spend more

133
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,965
if they want to get out of NASA
and into the Pentagon.

134
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,011
When they do, we can talk about Hilton.

135
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,972
Understood.

136
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,728
Oh, no. Yes, of course.

137
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,688
He's busy.

138
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,566
It's Wilson 4-8038.

139
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,778
Betty Draper. He can call me anytime.

140
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,491
It's a civic matter regarding Ossining.
Thank you.

141
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,452
Lunch!

142
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,750
Wash your hands, Bobby.

143
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,339
Draper residence.

144
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,008
Mrs. Draper, it's Henry Francis.

145
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,344
Yes, of course.

146
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,472
I appreciate
you getting back to me so quickly.

147
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,848
Stop it.

148
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,602
Could you hold just a moment?
I'm going to get on the extension.

149
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,978
Of course.

150
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,898
I'm going in the study. Hang up the phone.

151
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:40,991
Damn it!

152
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,204
- What is wrong with you?
- You said to hang up the phone.

153
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,289
After I pick up the phone.

154
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,166
Freeze.

155
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,588
Draper residence.

156
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,132
It's Henry again. We were disconnected.

157
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,426
I'm sorry about that. My son.

158
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:05,182
I know how that goes. How are you?
You must have had your baby by now.

159
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,811
Yes, I did. You remembered.

160
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,772
- What did you have?
- A little boy.

161
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,858
Can you get him registered by November?

162
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,737
I just realized, everyone who calls you
must want something.

163
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,073
Actually, I've been doing
most of the calling lately.

164
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,160
- What can I do for you?
- Well, we were hoping

165
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,414
you could stop the destruction
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.

166
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,417
- Who's we?
- I'm representing the Junior League

167
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,001
of Tarrytown.

168
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,965
They want to build a 3-million-gallon
water tank, and it's a very scenic area.

169
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,258
I know the area.

170
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,094
Well, it's practically
the governor's backyard.

171
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,388
That's true, but I grew up there as well.

172
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,682
- Really? Where?
- Mount Salem.

173
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:53,021
I'm heading upstate tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe I could stop by and take a look.

174
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,858
Well, tomorrow is Saturday.

175
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,862
No, of course. I work every day,
I forget other people don't.

176
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:00,988
No.

177
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,493
This is very important to me.
I think I could find the time.

178
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,707
- Is Swenson's Bakery still there?
- It is. And it has an air conditioner.

179
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,377
I'll buy you a cup of coffee, and then
we can take a hike to the reservoir.

180
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,423
- Is 3:00 too late for you?
- No, it's perfect. I'll make it work.

181
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,551
Well, I'll see you then, Mrs. Draper.

182
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,861
I can save you the trouble.
It's from him and it's expensive.

183
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,821
I'm going to fire her.

184
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,240
- What did you promise him?
- Who?

185
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,369
You're thick, do you know that?
That present, it's from Duck.

186
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:53,290
- Hermès. Nice.
- I hope yours is a different color.

187
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,170
"Elegance and success. Duck."
I wonder who wrote that for him.

188
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,631
- I don't trust him.
- Why?

189
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,592
Because he wants us?

190
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,178
- We're very important here.
- Who is?

191
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,350
- Did he put you on Hilton?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

192
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,978
Stop barging in here
and infecting me with your anxiety.

193
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,190
This is really beautiful.

194
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,026
He sent me a box of Cuban cigars.

195
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,403
Although I'm starting to think
they're not that hard to come by.

196
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:27,115
- Hilton Hotels? Did we get that?
- Do you live in a cave?

197
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,701
Conrad Hilton
came to see Don this morning.

198
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,121
- He was right there.
- Really? What was he like?

199
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,334
I only got a quick look at him.
He was skinny, like a cowboy.

200
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,837
My mother gave me his book. He's Catholic.

201
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,634
- It's going to be a huge account.
- Not as big as Lucky Strike.

202
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,803
But it would be nice to be playing
a little offense for once

203
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,472
instead of hiding from the FTC.

204
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,058
- He has a book?
- I really like this.

205
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:59,147
Look, I'm keeping this.
Duck said we're not tied together.

206
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,985
I'll keep my mouth shut
and you do whatever you want.

207
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,613
Do you know why
Duck doesn't work here anymore?

208
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,616
Because Don squeezed him out
when the British took over.

209
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,910
So what? Don didn't like him.

210
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,539
It's the world against Don,
and now it's someone else.

211
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,543
True, but Duck
would love to hit Don where it hurts.

212
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,422
Well, I'm not going anywhere,
and I'm not going to tell Don.

213
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,717
I'm not worried about you.
I'm worried about Duck.

214
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,385
Send it back.

215
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,855
When were you going to tell us about this?

216
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,026
I thought I'd let it be
an incoming phone call,

217
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,029
and then wait and see who took credit for it.

218
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,365
This is very exciting.

219
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,660
Despite its modest billings,

220
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,956
London is thrilled with Hilton's potential
for international growth.

221
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,667
Finally.

222
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,544
Huzzah!

223
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,799
If you don't mind my asking,
how did you make this happen?

224
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,093
We travel in the same circles.

225
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,513
Well, I don't know
if we should celebrate yet.

226
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,976
His lawyers called,
and there's a little matter of the contract.

227
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,938
Well, don't be afraid to push back.
I agreed to the New York hotels,

228
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,067
but everything else
should be under our terms.

229
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,738
I don't think you understand.
This is regarding your contract.

230
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,573
Or lack thereof.

231
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,202
It may seem like a formality to you,

232
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:40,415
but to Mr. Hilton it's a necessity that
all the principals in the firm be secured.

233
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,169
And honestly, I can't blame him.

234
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:51,176
- I'll give him my word.
- And he'll take it, but his lawyers won't.

235
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,690
Obviously, you'll want
your attorney to look it over.

236
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,110
That's Ben Michelson. It's fairly standard.

237
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,572
Three years, a non-compete clause,
a healthy raise.

238
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:19,079
That's very generous. I'll think about it.

239
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,165
I'm confused.

240
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,670
If someone handed me that contract,
I'd be filled with glee.

241
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,924
A three-year guarantee,
a $5,000 signing bonus? I...

242
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:36,138
- I've never seen that before.
- Well, we want to take care of him.

243
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,893
Look, I've gotten to know
Conrad Hilton a little bit.

244
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,063
And I think he'll enjoy
something he can't have,

245
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,109
and you should tell him
that it matters to me.

246
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,861
It matters to him.

247
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:55,240
Still, I don't think anyone told him
that it matters to me.

248
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,662
Well, this is the way it has to be.

249
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,416
And not just for Conrad Hilton,
but for Sterling Cooper.

250
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:10,088
I'd like you to take those papers home
for the weekend and think about that.

251
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,015
I'd be happy to.

252
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,649
I met him once.
He's a bit of an eccentric, isn't he?

253
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,363
Yes.

254
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,046
Oh, Jesus.

255
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,947
- Mrs. Draper.
- Mr. Francis.

256
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,324
I'm alone. I hope that's okay.

257
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,869
Oh, well. Actually,
my friend couldn't get away either.

258
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,584
- I appreciate your coming up.
- Please. I love coming back here.

259
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,172
- So much changes, so much doesn't.
- Like what? I'm interested.

260
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,466
Can I help you?

261
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,594
- Just an iced tea, please.
- That's fine for now.

262
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,438
- What was I saying?
- You were talking about coming back here.

263
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,109
Ossining has always been
a real mix of people.

264
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,695
Well, after living in Manhattan,
it wasn't my first choice,

265
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,572
but it's grown on me.

266
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,867
I lived in Manhattan when I was married.

267
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:06,079
It's okay for work, but I can't sleep
with all those people on top of me.

268
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:10,125
Like in a skyscraper. May I have a straw?

269
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,297
So, you have your folder.

270
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,468
I thought I'd just give you the literature
and a copy of the petition.

271
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,305
I don't know that I'm a great spokesman.

272
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,932
You don't have to tell me
how beautiful the reservoir is.

273
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,477
- I used to do jackknives into it.
- We drink that water.

274
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:35,567
I've looked into this for you,
and I'm afraid it's underway.

275
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,029
Oh, no. We're too late.

276
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,033
Maybe if you knew somebody
with some clout.

277
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,913
I don't even know what you do.

278
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:52,042
I'm a classic strategist, fundraiser,
maybe campaign manager.

279
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,337
- I'm waiting on that.
- And how do you become that?

280
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,590
- Give a lot of money?
- No.

281
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,509
No, I'm a lawyer, but I don't use it much.

282
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:07,682
We all have skills we don't use.
I was an anthropology major. Imagine that.

283
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:12,062
- Where?
- Bryn Mawr.

284
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,691
Well, you may be
saving your community right now.

285
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,694
I'm hungry. Do you mind?

286
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,614
- I don't know.
- Fine.

287
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,784
You can read from your folder
and watch me eat.

288
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,662
I'll have apple pie and...

289
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,539
Ice cream or cheddar cheese?

290
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,000
One of each.

291
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,838
Can we just get one thing out of the way?

292
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,844
I don't know what I can do
about the water tank.

293
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,477
Don't give up so easily.

294
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:58,149
What this really is, is a camera obscura.

295
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,152
We call it a sun scope.

296
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:05,365
And it allows us to look at the eclipse
without injury to our eyes.

297
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,827
- We didn't bring a scissor.
- I have scissors.

298
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,580
And squares of cardboard
that already have pinholes in them.

299
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,668
And if you really need some help,
ask your dads.

300
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,840
The eclipse is 22 minutes away.
Gentlemen, start your engines.

301
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:26,928
I could have gone golfing.
I had no idea this is what we'd be in for.

302
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,305
Go ahead. I'll take Ernie home.

303
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,852
You know, Francine taught school
when we were first married.

304
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:37,397
I used to love seeing her
standing in the middle of those little kids

305
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,650
like a telephone pole. Hey.

306
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,154
There you go.

307
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,741
Sally has a crush on her.

308
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,203
Why can't you stare into the eclipse?

309
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,957
What's it going to do, really?
I stare at the sun every day.

310
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,836
- You stare at the sun every day?
- Well, you know, look at it.

311
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,508
You know, I see her sometimes
when I'm out running in the morning.

312
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,636
- You run?
- Yeah, over by the high school track.

313
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,057
- Do you talk?
- No. No, there's an etiquette to it.

314
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,141
You keep to yourself.

315
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,812
And honestly, that's one of the things
I love about my run, is being alone.

316
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,482
That's hard to come by, you know?

317
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:30,116
Listen, I hate to disappoint you,
but I have to be on my way.

318
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,497
- That's too bad.
- I have to be in Albany for dinner.

319
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,790
His master's voice.

320
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,833
The governor.

321
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,672
"His master's voice"? It's an old ad.

322
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,343
I know what it is.

323
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,772
- What are you doing?
- It's the eclipse.

324
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,690
He made a contraption.

325
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,945
Don't look at it.

326
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,078
Are you okay?

327
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,498
I think so. I feel a little dizzy.

328
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,251
Take a deep breath.

329
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,548
Is that better?

330
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:33,429
So you never had time
to go to the reservoir anyway.

331
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,391
I only had an hour, but I figured...

332
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,102
That's what you need. A fainting couch.

333
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,396
What's that?

334
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:46,067
Victorian ladies would get overwhelmed
from corsets and things.

335
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,945
They'd need a place to lie down.

336
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,365
- How do you know that?
- I used to move furniture.

337
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,995
May I walk you to your car?

338
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:03,168
- I don't know. This is still a small town.
- No, of course.

339
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,296
- Mrs. Draper.
- Betty.

340
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,547
Henry.

341
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:13,136
So, that's a rain check for the hike.
I'll contact you as soon as I know anything.

342
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,063
You doing okay?

343
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,617
- You don't want to watch it?
- I will once it gets a little further along.

344
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:40,205
I don't know if you heard me before,
but it only happens once every 10 years.

345
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,290
You don't want to miss it.

346
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,377
- How's your summer going?
- It's good.

347
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:50,924
- Are you gonna take a vacation?
- I don't think so. I'll get August off,

348
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,636
then September I'm back at it.
It's all fairly prescribed.

349
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,140
Have you been here in August?
It's a ghost town.

350
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,644
- Where are you going?
- We'll be here.

351
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,814
So now I know that.

352
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:11,027
Most just come right out
and ask if I'm going to be around.

353
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,949
I was just making conversation.
You can change it if you want to.

354
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:19,327
You're all the same.
The drinking, the philandering.

355
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,587
They don't know that word.

356
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,508
Do you want me to leave you alone?
Just say so.

357
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,181
- It's hard because this happens a lot.
- Nothing is happening. We're just talking.

358
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,060
Okay.

359
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,106
And where I come from,
schoolteachers, especially, used to say

360
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,692
you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

361
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,320
- So you're different, huh?
- Is that impossible?

362
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,157
You're all wearing the same shirt.

363
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,834
So how do people live elsewhere?

364
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,006
They don't have as much.
They don't get as bored.

365
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,510
I'm not bored.

366
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,725
Miss Farrell. Miss Farrell. I can see it. Look!

367
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,065
Let me see it with you. Show me.

368
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,887
Yes, is he in?

369
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,933
Tell him it's Peggy Olson regarding Clorox.

370
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,436
Of course.

371
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,027
Hello.

372
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,738
Miss Olson, what a pleasant surprise.

373
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:23,076
I haven't changed my mind,
and I'd appreciate you not sending things.

374
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,454
- Things you want to keep?
- I'm sending it back.

375
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,123
And I hope you take that
as a definitive answer.

376
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,250
I would if you already sent it.

377
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:35,213
Listen. I've been having meetings
at The Pierre all day, suite 600.

378
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,466
At 4:30, Hermès comes by.
Give it back in person.

379
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,969
- Why are you meeting at The Pierre?
- Have you been to Grey?

380
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:45,139
It's a Penn Station toilet
with Venetian blinds.

381
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,809
I can't do that.

382
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,561
You can and you will,
then I'll leave you alone.

383
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,564
Suite 600 at 4:30, not the other way around.

384
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,235
Please don't contact me again.

385
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:09,497
- How was your weekend?
- Short.

386
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,212
- What did Michelson think of the contract?
- He hasn't gotten back to me.

387
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,008
That's because he didn't get it. I called him.

388
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:26,097
Are you afraid you're going to have a boss?
You will, the client.

389
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,934
- It's not that.
- What is the problem?

390
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,186
You think you're more dangerous
without a contract?

391
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,106
You are, and it's affecting our business.

392
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,357
You're our David Ogilvy,

393
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:40,194
and if you let all the blokes at Putnam,
Powell & Lowe relax for three years,

394
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:45,366
maybe we could put your name out front.
After mine. And Cooper, probably.

395
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:53,833
Well, I'll let you get back to work.
All I need is a letter of intent.

396
00:29:55,836 --> 00:30:00,798
Ben Michelson can rape us later.
Grunt once for "yes."

397
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,725
The problem is, I don't know
if you don't want to do this here

398
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,311
or you don't want to do this at all.

399
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,065
Didn't we give you an office?

400
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:23,279
I just need a minute.
I need to send Martinson's to the printer.

401
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,739
Come on in.

402
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,417
So, do you know
who you're gonna put on Hilton yet?

403
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,045
No.

404
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,963
Well, I don't know
if they want a woman's point of view,

405
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,174
- but I read his book, and...
- Who told you

406
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,927
we were going to land Hilton?
Because we're not.

407
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,721
And I resent you bringing work
in here under pretense.

408
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,807
- I didn't.
- I didn't need to sign off on this.

409
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,478
I'm sorry if... I was excited.

410
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,939
And I heard there was
an amazing assignment.

411
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,692
And you thought you'd come in here
and ask for it because I never say no.

412
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,611
You say no all the time.

413
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,614
What do I have to do for you?
Peggy, tell me.

414
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,243
You were my secretary,

415
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:15,206
and now you have an office and a job
that a lot of full-grown men would kill for.

416
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,334
Every time I turn around,
you've got your hand in my pocket.

417
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,962
You want a raise. You want this account.

418
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,422
Put your nose down
and pay attention to your work,

419
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,550
because there's not one thing
that you've done here

420
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,843
that I couldn't live without.

421
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,849
I'm sorry, Don.

422
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:38,813
You're good. Get better.
Stop asking for things.

423
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,902
Close the door.

424
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,826
Draper residence.

425
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,412
Betty. Roger Sterling. How are you?

426
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,707
- I'm well, thank you.
- Is Don about?

427
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,626
No, he's not home yet. Shall I leave word?

428
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:04,088
Actually, Betty, if I could be frank,
it's important.

429
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,216
- What's wrong?
- Well, it's a little touchy.

430
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,303
I don't want to put you
in a strange position.

431
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,684
- What's wrong, Roger?
- Well, it's about his contract.

432
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,061
What about it?

433
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,938
Look, I know you have to be
on the same page as him,

434
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:24,650
and he's your husband.
But it's a lot of money, Betty.

435
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,992
- Three years isn't that long, you know.
- I'm sorry. What do you want?

436
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,121
I want you to see what you can do
to get him to sign it.

437
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,373
I know you're the woman behind the man.

438
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:42,168
Don is going to do
whatever he's going to do.

439
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:46,464
And honestly, I find it terribly disrespectful
that you would go behind his back.

440
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,342
- Easy, Betty, that's not...
- I have to go.

441
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:56,265
You missed Hermès.
I was going to give you 10 more minutes.

442
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,730
You came all this way, have a drink.

443
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,406
- What are you having?
- Whatever you're having.

444
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:15,618
- I'm not having anything.
- A whiskey.

445
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,332
- You are Don's girl, aren't you?
- I was raised on whiskey.

446
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,002
Sit down.

447
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:28,631
A few minutes of adult conversation,
and we both go home.

448
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,848
Grey has Hermès, Macy's,

449
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,267
H.J. Heinz baby food and Revlon.

450
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,854
- You need someone in a skirt.
- Everybody does.

451
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,607
Copy chief?

452
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,070
Maybe once they get used to you,
but definitely more money.

453
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,074
- Would I get to go to Paris for Hermès?
- They come here,

454
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:59,120
but you're not going anywhere
where you are.

455
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,960
- I can't.
- Okay.

456
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,423
Just so you know,
that's what opportunity looks like.

457
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,597
I'm just sorry
I won't be seeing you every day.

458
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,977
What are you doing?

459
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:28,482
I was just thinking about all the times
I've walked by you and didn't even notice.

460
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,654
How is that possible?

461
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,876
What do you want from me?

462
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,589
I want to take you in that bedroom,
lock the door,

463
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55,301
take your clothes off with my teeth,
throw you on the bed

464
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,471
and give you a go-around
like you've never had.

465
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,992
Bobby, Sally, turn off the TV
and go upstairs.

466
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:28,584
- What's wrong?
- Roger Sterling called.

467
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,423
He pretended to be calling for you, and then
he started on me about your contract.

468
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:37,468
- What?
- Your contract, Don.

469
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,805
It was very uncomfortable.

470
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,977
- What are you doing?
- What do you think?

471
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,979
- I'm calling him.
- Don't.

472
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,398
Betts, don't worry about my job.

473
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:54,527
Why would I?
I don't know anything about it.

474
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,905
They offered you a contract
and you didn't say a damn thing to me.

475
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:02,159
I had to hear about it from him.
And why the hell won't you sign it?

476
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,165
It doesn't concern you. You're taken care of.

477
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,084
Why won't you sign it?

478
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,169
Let me explain something to you
about business,

479
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:15,923
since, as usual, you're turning this
into something about yourself.

480
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,886
No contract means I have all the power.
They want me, but they can't have me.

481
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,514
You're right.

482
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,809
Why would I think
that has anything to do with me?

483
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,813
It's three years, Don.

484
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:36,151
What's the matter? You don't know
where you're going to be in three years?

485
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,366
Good night.

486
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,309
I love the taste of liquor on your breath.

487
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,451
- Where you headed?
- Niagara Falls.

488
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,287
But we'll settle for the nearest motel.

489
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,872
Hop in.

490
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,675
Thank you.

491
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:47,348
- I'm Doug. This is Sandy.
- Nice to meet you.

492
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,352
- How far are we?
- A couple of miles.

493
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,899
You wanna know
why we're going to Niagara Falls?

494
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,195
- We're getting married.
- At Niagara Falls. Fancy that.

495
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:05,991
- People keep trying to talk us out of it.
- Why's that?

496
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,745
Well, we don't really
know each other that well.

497
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,456
Well, we knew each other
a little bit in high school,

498
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,376
and we're not really in love or anything.

499
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,380
I'm sure you have a good reason,
not that it's any of my business.

500
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,881
I'm not knocked up.

501
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:25,094
They're passing a law that if you're married,
they can't send you to Vietnam.

502
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:29,223
I don't know if you've served, mister.
I don't want to offend you.

503
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,017
Again, none of my business.

504
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:36,355
It's just I'm 1 -A. I'm 22.
I can't get into school.

505
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:40,067
I kind of have a target on my back,
and for what?

506
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,696
I think they're really
gonna start sending people.

507
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,074
I have it on good authority that you're right.

508
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,369
Good authority? Are you a spook?

509
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,543
Nope. I'm in advertising.

510
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,589
No way. Now that's priceless.

511
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,593
- But you seem okay.
- Thank you.

512
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,934
It's a beautiful night. It smells good.

513
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,605
But everything smells good
when you're high.

514
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,695
That's true.

515
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,158
Listen, Cadillac,

516
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,704
we don't have gas money, but...

517
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,499
Yeah.

518
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,836
- They're reds. You ever had them?
- What are they?

519
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,381
Phenobarbital. They're my dad's.

520
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,386
Give me one. Make it two.

521
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:20,250
- Does he know how to dance?
- Who cares?

522
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,468
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

523
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,054
How old are you?

524
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:42,272
- Why can't you go to school?
- Because it's a waste of time, man.

525
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:47,111
- You like to watch us dance?
- Yeah, you want to watch us?

526
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,711
A hillbilly knocks on the door
of his new neighbor's house.

527
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:06,964
"Howdy, neighbor," he says.

528
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,801
"In honor of you moving into the holler,
I'm gonna throw a party.

529
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,845
"There's gonna be a whole lot of drinking,

530
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:16,306
"a whole lot of dancing
and a whole lot of screwing."

531
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,478
"Sounds like fun," the neighbor says.
"What can I bring?"

532
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,732
The hillbilly replies,
"You can bring anything you want.

533
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,152
"It's just gonna be you and me."

534
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,994
What are you laughing at, Cadillac?

535
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,881
Look at you. Up to your old tricks.

536
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,217
You're a bum, you know that?

537
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,054
- No, I'm not.
- Conrad Hilton?

538
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,725
You wouldn't expect him
to be taken so easily.

539
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,103
- Shut up.
- You can't be tied down.

540
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,190
- That's right.
- Look at your hands.

541
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:09,026
They're as soft as a woman's.

542
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,197
What do you do? What do you make?

543
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,075
You grow bullshit.

544
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,140
- I gave him two.
- How the hell is he still awake?

545
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,098
Everything okay?

546
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,809
I'm worried that housekeeping
is going to come in.

547
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,271
I put out the sign.
I'll call them when we're done.

548
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:33,527
- I don't know.
- Come on. I love the morning.

549
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:44,246
What were you thinking? It's awful.

550
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,833
- It's an antique.
- We discussed this for months,

551
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:50,544
and we decided antiques were expected.

552
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:54,089
Look around!
You have ruined the whole room.

553
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:59,761
If you want to keep it,
please do not tell people I did this.

554
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,272
- Good morning.
- Fender bender.

555
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,901
I'm going to get coffee. Do you want some?

556
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,486
No, thank you.

557
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,160
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

558
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:26,788
- Fender bender.
- I'm sorry. Mr. Cooper's waiting for you.

559
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,915
Thank you.

560
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:34,796
- Good morning.
- Sit down.

561
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,344
What do you want?

562
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:45,557
Sacajawea carried a baby on her back
all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

563
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,854
And somewhere,
that baby thinks he discovered America.

564
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,234
You, Don, have been standing
on someone's shoulders.

565
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,613
We brought you in,
we nurtured you like family,

566
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,616
and now's the time to pay us back.

567
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,662
You can't go any further on your own, Don.

568
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:19,299
Would you say
I know something about you, Don?

569
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:24,888
I would.

570
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,022
Then sign.

571
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:43,448
After all, when it comes down to it,
who is really signing this contract anyway?

572
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,470
I don't want any more contact
with Roger Sterling.

573
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:19,651
Don?

574
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,115
I signed it.
