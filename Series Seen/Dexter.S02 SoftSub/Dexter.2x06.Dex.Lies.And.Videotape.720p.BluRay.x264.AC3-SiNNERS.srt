1
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:03,772
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:06,338
We have to catch them
in the act at the shipyard.

3
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:09,859
He's gonna find out,
and then he's gonna kill me.

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:12,728
Harry knew my mother.

5
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:16,004
Why would Rita print out
narcotics anonymous literature

6
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:17,247
If Paul's dead ?

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,861
Because recently
I entered the program.

8
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,286
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you that I'm fine ?

9
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:24,638
It's my department.

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:27,292
I need to know that you are fit for
duty. That's my job !

11
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:29,252
I always eat lunch at 1:00.

12
00:00:29,513 --> 00:00:32,498
You'll learn that about me.
Why don't you sit down ?

13
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:35,747
You're very fidgety.
Anyone ever tell you that ?

14
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,445
My father.

15
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:39,154
You applying for the job ?

16
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,813
Well, you said you'd call.

17
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:43,662
<i>Where are you,
and when are you coming back ?</i>

18
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:45,337
Tomorrow morning.

19
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:47,519
Promise me to stop by the house
1st thing.

20
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:48,672
See you.

21
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:51,030
- Is she OK with you doing this ?
- I didn't tell her.

22
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:52,424
I don't care what you did.

23
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,400
<i>I'm no longer sure
who made me what I am.</i>

24
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:56,916
<i>Funny thing is I've met someone
who doesn't care.</i>

25
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,562
- We need to talk about Coral Cove.
- What about coral cove ?

26
00:01:00,702 --> 00:01:02,452
The algae on the rocks
sent us there.

27
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:04,749
If I were you,
I'd consider moving your boat.

28
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:07,774
<i>- Security out there sucks.
- When I'm back, I'll hit the marina</i>

29
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:10,404
<i>and make sure there's
no blood traces on my boat.</i>

30
00:01:10,577 --> 00:01:12,029
It isn't a commercial marina.

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,472
But I can see the upkeep
on this place is dismal.

32
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:16,501
That's why I'm gonna order
24h surveillance

33
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:18,795
on this marina and the two others.

34
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:19,528
There's another shipment
coming in tomorrow.

35
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:21,624
Cocaine.

36
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:24,280
How much ?

37
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,590
300 bricks, give or take.

38
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,361
Can you get your hands on some ?

39
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,785
That wasn't part of our agreement.

40
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:37,777
We need hard evidence. Otherwise,
it's just your word against Estrada's.

41
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,228
I'll protect you.

42
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:42,700
I promise.

43
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:48,816
You better.

44
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,030
Do you meet me later ?

45
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,780
Laura, the tape's still rolling.

46
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:05,995
<i>Very convincing.</i>

47
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:09,504
What was that ?

48
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,277
<i>Laura, the tape's still rolling.</i>

49
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:21,867
Damn it.

50
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:25,204
<i>My mother...
Confidential informant...</i>

51
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:26,930
<i>and mumbler.</i>

52
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,971
<i>Whatever sweet nothings
she had to whisper</i>

53
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:33,061
<i>I probably don't want to hear.</i>

54
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:39,609
<i>It seems that my foster father and my
biological mother were having an affair.</i>

55
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,340
It's bad enough I can't shake
the visual. But the questions...

56
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:47,819
<i>Did he blame himself for her death ?
Is that why he took me in ?</i>

57
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,334
<i>Did he love her,</i>

58
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,388
<i>or was he just using her ?</i>

59
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:53,028
<i>Was he using me ?</i>

60
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:58,071
<i>I always thought Harry's code was
on-The-Spot creative problem-Solving,</i>

61
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:01,354
<i>But maybe he planned for me
to settle the score all along.</i>

62
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,909
<i>It's times like this I wish
I really were a drug addict.</i>

63
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:09,998
I had emotional problems as a kid
because of what happened to my mom.

64
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:13,197
Harry said he was trying to help me,
mut we only talked about his rules.

65
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,596
I spent so much time
trying to live up to his expectations

66
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:18,962
because I thought he had
my best interests in mind.

67
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:22,716
If you come over this late, the least
you could do is bring me a coffee.

68
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,491
- Sorry.
- Cappuccino...

69
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,545
Make a note of it.

70
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,210
Truth is, Dex,

71
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,848
It doesn't really matter
why Harry did what he did.

72
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,619
The result's the same.

73
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:41,444
You have an addiction.

74
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:45,555
Do you think Harry
made me what I am ?

75
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:49,073
Plenty of people go through trauma
without turning to addiction.

76
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,106
Whatever Harry taught you
led you down the wrong path.

77
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,192
But I've built everything
in my life

78
00:05:57,371 --> 00:05:59,472
on what Harry said
I was supposed to be.

79
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:01,358
My job, my girlfriend...

80
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,758
It's all what Harry
told me I needed.

81
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,760
What do you think you need ?

82
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:12,159
I have no idea.

83
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:15,152
Whatever's inside you
is splattered all over

84
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:17,529
that paper I took from your lab.

85
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,197
Looks messy.

86
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:22,441
It probably is.

87
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:24,995
Look, Dexter.

88
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:28,296
Everyone has a moment

89
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:31,659
when they realize their value system
is different from their parents'.

90
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:35,186
Mine was in college, but...

91
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:37,248
maybe you're a late bloomer.

92
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:39,952
- Lucky me.
- Damn right, lucky you.

93
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:42,929
You get to have a fresh start.

94
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:46,495
Whatever you thought or did
doesn't matter.

95
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,864
Now you get to figure out who you are.

96
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,071
<i>I went to Lila for answers,
but now all I have is more questions.</i>

97
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:01,402
<i>Who am I ? What do I need ?</i>

98
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:02,971
<i>What do I want ?</i>

99
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:06,152
<i>Coffee. I really want
a cup of coffee.</i>

100
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:08,940
- What up, half-day ?
- Is there coffee left ?

101
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,336
You're late.

102
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,696
I fell asleep before you got home
last night. Were you at Rita's ?

103
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:18,031
You're welcome, ass.

104
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:21,480
- Your brother looks like shit.
- Tell me about it.

105
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,548
I may be out of line with this,
but did he fall off the wagon ?

106
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,123
What wagon ?

107
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,712
The only wagon he's ever had
is a radio flyer.

108
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,645
Your brother's a junkie.

109
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:34,295
Isn't he ?

110
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:40,054
Are you high ?
He's never even smoked a cigarette.

111
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:43,572
I'm glad you got
some new material, though,

112
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:46,962
'cause "freak" and "psycho"
were getting kind of tired.

113
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,036
Agent Lundy ?

114
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:05,795
So, I hear a rumor you're tracking
all our Internet activity.

115
00:08:06,497 --> 00:08:07,516
Is it true ?

116
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:10,497
'Cause I can explain
all that she-male stuff.

117
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:14,410
I need my team outside in five minutes.

118
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,431
That sounds important.

119
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,493
Got a major break in the investigation.

120
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:21,245
Patrol found a guy saying he
escaped the Bay Harbor Butcher.

121
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,717
He claimed he was captured
two hours ago.

122
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,544
<i>That's a neat trick,
considering I was asleep.</i>

123
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:28,392
<i>At least trying to sleep.</i>

124
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:30,178
<i>This could be good news for me.</i>

125
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:31,706
- Morgan ?
- Yes ?

126
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:33,441
The other Morgan.

127
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:36,235
I'd like you to join us,
if you can spare him.

128
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,668
That's fine with me.

129
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:40,621
- Is there blood ?
- Not that I'm aware of.

130
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:42,354
But what about Masuka ?

131
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:45,305
Yeah, I'm the lead forensics
investigator.

132
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:49,171
Masuka's lab work is more pressing.
I need him to hold down the fort here.

133
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:51,674
He totally saw the she-male stuff.

134
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:53,187
So, what do you say ?

135
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,122
I'll buy you lunch after.
Pork sandwich, right ?

136
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,448
- Yes. Sure.
- Good.

137
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,944
I figured it was time to get
a fresh perspective on the case.

138
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,074
Rumor has it you have a knack
for attracting serial killers.

139
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,405
I hear the same about you.

140
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:12,232
Dexter also enjoys long walks
on the beach and foreign films.

141
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:14,730
Then we got a lot to talk about.

142
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:39,388
He knocked me out.

143
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:43,360
Then when I woke up, I was tied up
in that train car over there.

144
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,111
- You said he used rope ?
- Dumb fuck.

145
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,086
I stretched it out enough
so I can get my legs free

146
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:50,672
and I got out of there.

147
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:53,576
Ran across the road, almost got hit
by that guy in the car.

148
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,697
<i>So, that's the alleged victim
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.</i>

149
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,533
<i>But I've never seen him
before in my life.</i>

150
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:06,338
O'Connor, Singer, make sure
you take pictures of those footprints.

151
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,158
- Hey, Dex.
- Hey.

152
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:11,879
So, the victim says the Butcher
held him in this train car.

153
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,358
Lundy wants you to search
for trace evidence.

154
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:17,538
- Your spidey sense tingling yet ?
- We'll see when I get inside.

155
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:18,886
Take your time.

156
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,359
<i>We've never been this close
to this pendejo.</i>

157
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:23,784
<i>Closer than you think, amigo.</i>

158
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,710
<i>He may have borrowed my pseudonym,
but this guy doesn't know</i>

159
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:41,062
<i>the first thing about my techniques.</i>

160
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:42,824
<i>Amateur.</i>

161
00:10:43,922 --> 00:10:45,556
Why do you think it was the Butcher ?

162
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:49,340
He told me the Bay Harbor
Butcher's gonna clean up Miami.

163
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:51,943
He said, "You're gonna get
what you deserve".

164
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:54,124
And what do you deserve, Mr. Henry ?

165
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:57,633
Well, look.
The Butcher kills criminals, right ?

166
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,192
I just got out of jail, you know.

167
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:04,267
Six years for aggravated assault
and home invasion, so...

168
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:07,715
He kills murderers.
You didn't kill anyone, did you ?

169
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,699
Alright, I gave this old guy
a heart attack.

170
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,179
It's not like I was doing it
on purpose, alright ?

171
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:17,187
I used to hit retirement homes,
communities.

172
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:19,673
Snowbirds are easy targets.

173
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,319
And I don't do that anymore.
I did my time.

174
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:25,477
Your mother must be so proud.

175
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:30,284
I wanna check out
the train car with your brother.

176
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,460
Why don't you keep an eye
on our friend here

177
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,534
while we confirm his story ?

178
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:40,179
Sure.

179
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,655
<i>Killing tools left behind.
I'd never be this careless.</i>

180
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,662
<i>Whoever did this would
never pass Harry's muster.</i>

181
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:51,802
<i>Then again, neither would Harry.</i>

182
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:53,574
<i>He lied about my past,</i>

183
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:57,204
<i>he cheated on my foster mother
with my biological mother.</i>

184
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,832
<i>Maybe Lila's right.
It's time for a new set of standards.</i>

185
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,332
If you were the Bay Harbor Butcher,

186
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:05,867
would you use a place like this ?

187
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:09,891
Actually, yes.

188
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:12,214
Location wise, it's not a bad choice.

189
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:13,845
It's quiet,

190
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:15,569
remote.

191
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:19,077
Could use an upgrade in
the lighting department, but...

192
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,779
You think this is our guy ?

193
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:28,350
Not exactly.

194
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:31,532
From what I understand,

195
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:34,399
the conditions in this space
don't support his M.O.

196
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:36,467
It's filthy, for one thing.

197
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,428
Butcher's clean...

198
00:12:41,163 --> 00:12:42,214
orderly.

199
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,765
And some people would say compulsive.

200
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:55,621
Really ? You think he's compulsive ?

201
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,775
That doesn't fit either.

202
00:12:58,322 --> 00:12:59,862
A hatchet is sloppy.

203
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,021
The butcher uses precise
surgical instruments.

204
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,999
He's not that predictable.

205
00:13:07,238 --> 00:13:10,176
Is he ? Mixes it up.
Different tools every time.

206
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:12,006
And never rope.

207
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:14,665
He uses duct tape and plastic wrap.

208
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:18,601
- Plastic wrap, how can you tell ?
- Depression patterns in the skin.

209
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:22,766
Maybe the butcher's having
an identity crisis.

210
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:27,657
- It's entirely possible.
- But not likely.

211
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,906
My guess is we're looking
for a vigilante

212
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:33,380
inspired by the butcher's principles.

213
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:36,327
Bet he never thought
he'd be a role model.

214
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,163
I bet you're right.

215
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:40,677
So,

216
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:43,291
any new leads on the real guy ?

217
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,466
Not yet.

218
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:47,413
We hope the cameras'll
turn something up.

219
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:49,441
- Cameras ?
- In the marinas.

220
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,559
Put them in a couple of days ago
to monitor for suspicious activities.

221
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,660
Good news for all those cops
who keep boats at Coral Cove.

222
00:13:57,848 --> 00:13:59,368
You've got one, too, right ?

223
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:08,225
We've been needing a security
upgrade for a long time now.

224
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:12,246
<i>Has Lundy seen me on the tape ?</i>

225
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:15,761
<i>Is that why he invited me
along today ? To mess with me ?</i>

226
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,831
Sorry if I was short with you
this morning.

227
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:28,033
I'm lost without my morning coffee.
- Whatever.

228
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:32,118
How was your playdate
with Lundy ? Did you bond ?

229
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:35,752
You didn't tell me they put up
security cameras at the marinas.

230
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,462
It's not like
they're doing us any good.

231
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:40,649
The station's computers
need an update

232
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:42,877
so we can synch up with
Lundy's equipment.

233
00:14:43,108 --> 00:14:47,051
- The cameras aren't recording ?
- They are, but nobody saw the footage.

234
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,275
Lundy said it should be fixed
by tonight.

235
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:50,813
That's a relief.

236
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:05,171
Your mom told me about
your cultural presentation at school.

237
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,693
Did your teacher give you
a country yet ?

238
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,394
Saudi Arabia.

239
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,858
No. That's israel.

240
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:15,748
I won't tell the Saudis
you said that.

241
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:18,170
Looks like Cody's enjoying himself.

242
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:20,477
Dexter's very patient with him.

243
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,564
Dexter's a saint.

244
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:24,427
Where's Astor ?

245
00:15:24,897 --> 00:15:26,578
Uh, she's by the water.

246
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,317
I want to say goodbye.

247
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,049
I gotta go.
I was supposed to meet Lila

248
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,650
10 minutes ago.

249
00:15:35,524 --> 00:15:36,727
Who's Lila ?

250
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:38,578
His sponsor.

251
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:40,484
Really ? A woman ?

252
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:45,988
Dexter's sponsor is a woman.
Is that a problem ?

253
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,313
Is she attractive ?

254
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:51,687
- Mom...
- I'm just curious.

255
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:53,541
Is she ?

256
00:15:55,283 --> 00:15:56,611
I have an idea.

257
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:58,953
Why don't you and Lila
have dinner with us ?

258
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,640
That's very kind of you,
Gail, but...

259
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,144
I think it'd be really nice
if we got to know the woman

260
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:06,860
you spend so much time with.

261
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,543
- Mom, they're doing step work.
- But they have to eat, right ?

262
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,375
Here. Let me help.

263
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:19,684
Thank you.

264
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:26,317
So lovely of you to have me over.

265
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:31,443
Now I can put names to faces.
Dexter talks about you all the time.

266
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,333
Good things, I hope.

267
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,368
Dexter never says a bad word
about anyone.

268
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:50,915
Tell me, Lila.

269
00:16:51,422 --> 00:16:53,698
What exactly
are you recovering from ?

270
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:58,286
I'm a meth addict, sober five years.

271
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:00,746
I don't know much about meth.

272
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,272
- Rita's ex-Husband shot heroin.
- Like Dexter.

273
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,060
Guess we know your type, don't we ?

274
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:10,381
Just can't seem to help myself.

275
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:16,512
You have nothing to worry about...
with Dexter, I mean.

276
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:20,474
I'm sitting right here.

277
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,728
- I didn't mean to imply...
- No. I completely understand.

278
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:25,328
Rita's your little baby.

279
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:28,482
You have every right to be concerned.

280
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,621
But if I can reassure you,
Dexter's doing incredibly well.

281
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,592
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

282
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,362
And I'm sure it's got everything
to do with the two of you.

283
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:41,329
He tells me you're very supportive.

284
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:43,794
Dexter's lucky to have you.

285
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:46,250
Well... that's very sweet
of you to say.

286
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,921
So, tell us more about yourself.

287
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,488
Dexter tells me you're an artist.

288
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:55,718
Yeah, she does amazing things
with a...

289
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,803
blowtorch. What's it called ?

290
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,144
Talent.

291
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:06,145
But... I'm not
the only artist at the table.

292
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:13,277
- Since when ?
- It's not really art.

293
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:16,864
She's talking about a blood-spatter
pattern she took from work.

294
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:20,076
What kind of career choice
is blood spatter, exactly ?

295
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,115
He helps catch criminals, mother.

296
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:29,168
And it makes perfect sense, what with
Dexter's mother and everything.

297
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,359
You know...

298
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:35,845
she's...

299
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:37,594
dead.

300
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:44,537
Forgot the bread.

301
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,354
Dinner was fantastic, Rita.

302
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,815
And this dessert...

303
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:59,331
I never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of like her.

304
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:01,544
Yeah, me too.

305
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:03,399
She's really helping me.

306
00:19:05,803 --> 00:19:08,486
I wish she didn't have
to help you tonight.

307
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,049
Why ? What are you thinking ?

308
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:15,107
- My mom could watch the kids.
- I have to swing by the office tonight.

309
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:18,539
I need to take care
of something really important.

310
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:22,393
I mean, can't it wait till morning ?

311
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,479
I promise we'll go straight to bed.

312
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:26,648
You're very convincing,

313
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:29,123
but it needs to get done tonight.

314
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:32,249
Just give me an hour, okay ?

315
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:34,601
Meet you back at my place ?

316
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:44,595
I still think it's funny
you write children's books.

317
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:46,419
Yeah, a big, tough guy like me

318
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:49,585
should be do something manly,
like wrangling cattle.

319
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,933
I don't even know any kids' books.

320
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:54,428
My dad told me cop stories before bed.

321
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:58,582
It was really the only alone
time I ever got with him.

322
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,136
You okay ?

323
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:03,596
Yeah.

324
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:08,142
Sorry, just an annoying day at work.

325
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:14,482
You know the FBI guy
I was talking about ?

326
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:18,544
I was really starting to feel
like I was his go-to girl,

327
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,687
But...

328
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:23,074
he realized Dexter
is the superior Morgan.

329
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,117
I should be used to it, you know ?

330
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:27,944
It was like that with my dad, work.

331
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:30,498
I guess I hoped Lundy
would be different.

332
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,625
- Why ?
- I don't know.

333
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,160
I respect him.

334
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,056
He's great at his job,

335
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:41,313
supersmart,

336
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:47,651
And, like, funny, but in this really
dry way where he doesn't even know it.

337
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:49,966
You love him.

338
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:51,740
What ?

339
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:55,773
You totally have a crush on Grundy.

340
00:20:56,034 --> 00:20:58,317
- Lundy.
- Now you're getting touchy about it.

341
00:20:58,578 --> 00:21:00,460
I don't have a crush on him.

342
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:02,163
He's like my dad.

343
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:05,179
Except I spent my life trying
to get my dad to notice me,

344
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:07,790
and he actually pays attention
to what I say.

345
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,537
And grundy loves you.

346
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:11,020
Oh, fuck off.

347
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:32,268
<i>Lundy's good - Double-Locked...</i>

348
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:35,929
<i>and a bit beyond my expertise.</i>

349
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:39,215
<i>I could try to crack it open,
but in my own station...</i>

350
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:41,996
<i>too risky.</i>

351
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:56,255
I can do this more often now
that my mom's in town.

352
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,223
I feel like we're being bad.

353
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:04,712
Bad...

354
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:06,544
Bad is good.

355
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,513
Let the machine get it.

356
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:13,744
<i>Hey, Dex, just calling to check in.</i>

357
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:15,996
<i>Thought we could do
the debriefing on dinner.</i>

358
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,980
<i>I thought it went well, don't you ?</i>

359
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:19,374
I'd say so.

360
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:22,667
<i>Rita's sweet, very Martha Stewart.</i>

361
00:22:24,057 --> 00:22:25,446
I love Martha Stewart.

362
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:29,825
<i>God, her mum, she's got quite
the rod up her ass, doesn't she ?</i>

363
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,448
<i>By the way, I am such a twat.</i>

364
00:22:31,627 --> 00:22:33,995
<i>I can't believe I almost
slipped up about your mum.</i>

365
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,589
<i>At least, I didn't spill the beans
about our road trip.</i>

366
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:39,724
Don't you dare !

367
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:42,151
<i>Can you imagine Rita's face
if I told her you and I</i>

368
00:22:42,312 --> 00:22:44,215
<i>spent the night together in a hotel ?</i>

369
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,171
<i>Anyway...</i>

370
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:48,719
You and Lila stayed
in a hotel together ?

371
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,722
- We had adjoining rooms.
- Adjoining rooms ? Right.

372
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,819
God, I am such an idiot.

373
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:57,092
I can't believe I defended you while
you were sleeping with another woman.

374
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,104
Wait.

375
00:22:58,365 --> 00:23:01,107
I thought you were different than Paul,
but you're the same.

376
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:04,311
Actually, you're worse.
You made me trust you.

377
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:08,781
- Please, just let me explain.
- I've had it !

378
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:12,424
I have been patient and understanding,
but there's only so much I can take.

379
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:15,713
You're a liar and a cheat,
and I am through.

380
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:17,717
It's over, Dexter !

381
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:26,841
<i>Tracy Jenkins was given the liver
of a 9-year-old...</i>

382
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,231
Hi, honey.

383
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,680
I thought you were spending
the night at Dexter's.

384
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:34,348
We had a fight.

385
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,351
- I think we broke up.
- What ?

386
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,044
Mama's here.

387
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:54,452
<i>Yesterday I was so hopeful.</i>

388
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,783
<i>A new me, a new life.</i>

389
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:00,458
<i>But a life without Rita
seems strange.</i>

390
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:05,671
What in the name of fuck
are you doing up so early ?

391
00:24:06,508 --> 00:24:08,514
I got to get to the station.

392
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:22,281
Are you okay ?

393
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:25,039
You seem weird.

394
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:26,817
Weirder than usual.

395
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,904
Rita broke up with me last night.

396
00:24:30,165 --> 00:24:31,405
Seriously ?

397
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:36,489
What happened ?

398
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:39,477
It's a long story.

399
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:40,978
I've got time.

400
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:43,751
Yeah... but I don't.

401
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:46,295
Cliff Notes.

402
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:50,376
She thinks I did something bad,
but I didn't.

403
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:52,969
Did you tell her that ?

404
00:24:53,463 --> 00:24:56,837
I tried, but she dumped me
before I had a chance to explain.

405
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,267
She said, "It's over," and left.

406
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:03,230
- Did you go after her ?
- Was I supposed to ?

407
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:04,904
You're such a guy.

408
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:08,520
When I get pissed, I say stuff
I don't mean all the time. "I hate you,"

409
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:09,735
"I faked it,"

410
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:12,029
- "You're hung like a grape".
- You lost me.

411
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,408
When Rita said, "it's over," I'm sure
she didn't actually mean it.

412
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,370
Stop being a douche bag
and go fight for her.

413
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:22,575
She's fucking perfect.

414
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:24,337
I know.

415
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:39,412
Sure, I'll be right there.

416
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,001
Yeah. I'll tell him.

417
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,091
Who's that, Gabriel ?

418
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:52,450
No, Lundy.

419
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:56,316
He's holding a meeting at the station
about the bay harbor case.

420
00:25:57,043 --> 00:25:59,425
He specifically requested
that you be there.

421
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:02,330
<i>I missed my window.
He's already seen the footage.</i>

422
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:06,125
- Me ? Why ?
- Because you're his new butt buddy.

423
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:09,862
You gonna be okay ?

424
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,506
Check back with me later.

425
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:21,390
<i>The show has already started, but have
they seen the feature presentation ?</i>

426
00:26:21,735 --> 00:26:25,311
<i>Bane of the Bay Harbor Butcher,
starring Dexter Morgan as himself ?</i>

427
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:26,896
It's all synched up ?

428
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:31,317
Yep, you can watch streaming video
of the marina right now if you want to.

429
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:34,669
Yeah. Maybe you'll get to see
some pontoon poon.

430
00:26:36,774 --> 00:26:38,565
Did you... need something ?

431
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:41,202
<i>That's not my marina...</i>

432
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:42,463
<i>yet.</i>

433
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,373
<i>I'll be making my on-screen debut
soon enough.</i>

434
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:47,964
<i>I've got to find a way
to get to those video files.</i>

435
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:50,109
The media frenzy about the Butcher

436
00:26:50,313 --> 00:26:52,380
has come back to bite us.
Big surprise.

437
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:54,924
Now we've got a wannabe
vigilante out there

438
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:57,344
Who liked the Butcher's style
and thought,

439
00:26:57,484 --> 00:26:59,977
"Hey, I should try this at home".

440
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:03,641
He attacked this man - John Henry,

441
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:06,352
Ex-convict, preyed on the elderly.

442
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,728
It gets better.

443
00:27:08,037 --> 00:27:11,607
<i>I have already received reports
of ads on Craig's list</i>

444
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:15,111
and coffee-shop bulletin boards
requesting the services of the Butcher.

445
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:18,179
People think they've found
their own personal Batman.

446
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,594
This is not good news.

447
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,747
If this kind of thing catches on,
We're looking at an epidemic.

448
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:26,727
- Kind of like herpes.
- Fuck, Masuka, I'm trying to listen.

449
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:29,228
One in four, Morgan. One in four.

450
00:27:29,444 --> 00:27:32,047
Vigilante justice is
domestic terrorism.

451
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:35,756
And terrorism prevention
is the FBI's top priority.

452
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:38,092
I've done my best to be diplomatic,

453
00:27:39,176 --> 00:27:41,644
but if we lose one life
to a vigilante,

454
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:45,808
I will pull this case from Miami Metro
and hand it over in full

455
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:47,935
to the FBI. It's a promise.

456
00:27:48,195 --> 00:27:51,188
<i>That's a disaster.
It'd be raining feds in Miami.</i>

457
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:54,112
So, if we want to keep
the investigation here,

458
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:55,828
we need to nip this in the bud,

459
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:58,408
make an example
of our would-be vigilante.

460
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:01,107
The last thing we need is
a bunch of weekend warriors...

461
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:03,013
I think I found a suspect.

462
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,769
Could you ?

463
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,372
Ken Olson.

464
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:17,241
Olson's mother was hurt badly
in a home-invasion robbery.

465
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,393
Guess who hurt her.

466
00:28:19,553 --> 00:28:21,879
Please, tell me John Henry,
our train-Car victim.

467
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:24,548
I think Olson attacked him
for revenge.

468
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:26,692
- Any evidence ?
- Only circumstantial.

469
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:29,636
- Can you get him here for questioning ?
- Can't find him.

470
00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:32,872
OK. Leak this to some
of your media contacts.

471
00:28:33,138 --> 00:28:36,879
Let's beat this guy out of the bushes.
Nice work, detective. Let's get moving.

472
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,804
I need hard evidence on this
Olson character, and fast.

473
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:42,425
And if you can find the guy,
even better.

474
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,977
<i>The full force of the FBI -
That's the last thing I need.</i>

475
00:28:46,117 --> 00:28:47,908
<i>I've got to make sure Lundy
gets his man...</i>

476
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,104
<i>after I figure out a way
to erase the marina files</i>

477
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:52,840
<i>and make up with my girlfriend.</i>

478
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:56,621
<i>Then maybe I'll tackle world hunger
'cause things can't really get worse.</i>

479
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:01,219
<i>Another shipment's coming in
tomorrow.</i>

480
00:29:01,452 --> 00:29:02,354
<i>Cocaine.</i>

481
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:03,612
<i>How much ?</i>

482
00:29:03,897 --> 00:29:05,629
<i>300 bricks, give or take.</i>

483
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:07,247
Turn it off.

484
00:29:07,518 --> 00:29:09,352
<i>That wasn't part
of our agreement, Harry.</i>

485
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:11,199
I said turn it off.

486
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:15,911
I heard what you said.
I just don't take orders from you.

487
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,854
Is there a reason you're
in my lab, sergeant Doakes ?

488
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:21,735
Is there a reason you're listening
to tapes as old as you are ?

489
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:25,627
I had a little talk with your sister.

490
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:27,844
Turns out she didn't know
you were in program.

491
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:31,661
- Anonymous, sergeant.
- How long did you say you been clean ?

492
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:35,056
Actually, I didn't because it's
none of your goddamn business.

493
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:38,305
So, if I were to take a hair
from your desk and run it for drugs,

494
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:40,372
it would come back positive, right ?

495
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:44,257
Because why would someone
pretend to be an addict if he's not...

496
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:48,546
unless he's got something
a hell of a lot worse to hide ?

497
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:49,735
Back...

498
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:51,758
the fuck...

499
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:53,380
off.

500
00:29:53,886 --> 00:29:56,387
You want to hit me ? Go for it.

501
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:59,776
I've been waiting for a chance
to take your ass out.

502
00:30:01,865 --> 00:30:03,860
I know how you feel, sergeant.

503
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:21,603
I want to file a formal
complaint against Doakes.

504
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:23,621
Jesus, Dexter, the two of you...

505
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:25,435
He crossed the line, lieutenant !

506
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,326
He broke into my lab.
He went through my personal things.

507
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:31,029
He threatened me. He's probably
gonna start tailing me again.

508
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,506
- Sergeant Doakes tailed you ?
- For weeks, maybe longer.

509
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,441
OK, you have every right
to file a complaint,

510
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,544
but before you do that, I'd like
the chance to talk to James myself.

511
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,024
He's really not much of a talker.

512
00:30:46,265 --> 00:30:49,025
I'm asking you, as a personal
favor to me, to hold off.

513
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,949
Can you do that ?

514
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:54,445
Yeah.

515
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:58,496
Okay, in the meantime,
I strongly encourage you

516
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,616
to take a break for a couple of hours.
Just go somewhere. Cool off.

517
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:03,642
No.

518
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:06,540
- Excuse me ?
- I need to be here, lieutenant.

519
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:08,675
This is really not a good time
for me to leave.

520
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:11,030
It isn't a suggestion, Dexter.
It's an order.

521
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:12,782
Clear the station. Clear your head.

522
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,964
I don't want to see you here
until after lunch.

523
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:18,464
Understood ?

524
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:45,037
Blimey, look at you.

525
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,707
You wanna tell me what's going on ?

526
00:31:57,017 --> 00:31:58,220
What's going on ?

527
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,149
Being the new me sucks.

528
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:04,015
I'm about to be found out
at work for what I am.

529
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:05,983
For what I really am.

530
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:08,183
And I can't do anything to stop it

531
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,899
because I got kicked
out of the office to cool off.

532
00:32:11,184 --> 00:32:13,117
It seems to be going well for you.

533
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:16,179
Add to that the fact
that Rita heard your message

534
00:32:16,492 --> 00:32:17,915
and dumped me last night.

535
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,146
I tried to explain to her nothing
happened, but she wouldn't listen to me.

536
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:24,581
- Nobody fucking listens to me !
- Listen, you need to calm down.

537
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:27,080
Last time, you came back
covered in blood.

538
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,096
So ?

539
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:31,105
You said I was supposed
to feel my feelings.

540
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:33,533
Now I tell you to get them
under control.

541
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,715
- You don't understand.
- Why don't you make me ?

542
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,038
Which step was that ?

543
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,436
The naughty one.

544
00:33:49,156 --> 00:33:50,769
What are you thinking ?

545
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:57,161
Absolutely nothing.

546
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:04,407
I guess we found a way to quiet
the voices in your head.

547
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,959
I guess so.

548
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,374
How do you feel ?

549
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,546
Much better...

550
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,248
actually.

551
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:24,312
I guess I must be
a good sponsor after all.

552
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,569
Definitely.

553
00:34:37,577 --> 00:34:39,408
And where are you off to ?

554
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:42,636
I still have that thing at work
to deal with.

555
00:34:42,903 --> 00:34:44,684
Well, come back tomorrow.

556
00:34:45,238 --> 00:34:47,794
I promise you some serious recovery.

557
00:34:58,266 --> 00:34:59,099
Hello ?

558
00:34:59,345 --> 00:35:00,466
<i>Dexter, hey.</i>

559
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:04,313
- You at work ?
- I will be soon.

560
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:07,348
I was just taking a break.

561
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:09,403
<i>What's going on ?</i>

562
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:11,704
I'd really like
to get together and talk.

563
00:35:11,873 --> 00:35:14,319
I don't like how our last
conversation ended.

564
00:35:14,498 --> 00:35:15,464
Me neither.

565
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:19,095
<i>You said you wanted to explain,
and I owe it to you to hear you out.</i>

566
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:20,467
I owe it to us.

567
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:24,456
Okay.

568
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:28,011
So, can you come over after work ?

569
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,880
Sure.

570
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,282
Great.

571
00:35:34,015 --> 00:35:37,424
<i>Apparently my new life
involves a love triangle.</i>

572
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:38,788
<i>I'm that guy.</i>

573
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,888
<i>The voices are back. Excellent.</i>

574
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:56,506
You were tailing Dexter ?
What the hell were you thinking ?

575
00:35:56,646 --> 00:35:58,969
If you wanted to have lunch,
you could have asked.

576
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,618
If Dexter files a complaint, you will be
kicked off the force, end of story.

577
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:06,406
There's a reason he hasn't
reported me until now.

578
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:08,490
He's hiding something.
I can feel it.

579
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:11,042
Is this another one
of your conspiracy theories ?

580
00:36:11,258 --> 00:36:13,624
It's instinct and a hell
of a lot of experience.

581
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:16,680
I've spent years looking
the enemy in the face,

582
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:19,219
and I'm telling you
Morgan is dangerous.

583
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:23,230
Your instincts haven't been
that great these days, James.

584
00:36:23,535 --> 00:36:25,725
Two shootings in the last six months,

585
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:27,475
Stalking a police employee...

586
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:28,994
Listen to me.

587
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:33,467
Morgan lied
about the Ice-Truck Killer.

588
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:35,605
That crack pipe knew
more than he told us.

589
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:38,878
He was trying to protect his sister.
You of all people should understand.

590
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,666
I followed him to an N.A. meeting.
That asshole lied about that too.

591
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:45,201
- You're obsessed.
- I'm not.

592
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:47,782
You are,
and I need you to see it...

593
00:36:48,117 --> 00:36:49,995
as your boss and as your friend.

594
00:36:51,162 --> 00:36:52,705
We've been through this before.

595
00:36:52,884 --> 00:36:55,219
Last time it cost you
our relationship.

596
00:36:55,418 --> 00:36:58,584
This time it's gonna get you
kicked off the force or worse.

597
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:00,553
I'll take my chances.

598
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:06,349
Let it go.

599
00:37:07,037 --> 00:37:08,198
I mean it.

600
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:10,085
Leave Dexter alone.

601
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:22,198
The Batista suspect come in yet,
the wannabe vigilante ?

602
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:25,317
Olson just came in.
Saw himself on the 3:00 news

603
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:27,461
and showed up with his lawyer.

604
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:30,654
I hope we nail his ass to the wall.

605
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:32,989
I love it when you talk dirty.

606
00:37:37,177 --> 00:37:38,871
- Morgan ?
- Right here.

607
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:40,666
The other Morgan.

608
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,473
I didn't know you were a smoker.

609
00:37:47,123 --> 00:37:48,840
Have you seen Dexter Morgan ?

610
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:51,138
He's on a break. Why ?

611
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:54,023
Detective Batista's got
a suspect in interview room 1.

612
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:57,135
We think he's the would-be vigilante
who attacked our train-car victim.

613
00:37:57,286 --> 00:37:59,542
I need him to take some scrapings
for evidence.

614
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:02,673
You want to use Dexter again ?
Isn't Masuka on your task force ?

615
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:06,951
Yes, he is.

616
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,357
So, Mr. Olson, the man who assaulted
your mom was attacked yesterday.

617
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:15,744
- Did you know that ?
- Nope.

618
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:19,171
Can't say I'm upset, though.
Son of a bitch almost killed my mom.

619
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:20,976
My client's emotional, detective.

620
00:38:21,137 --> 00:38:24,333
- I'm sure he's not trying to say...
- Any idea who might have done it ?

621
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:26,873
I don't know.
Maybe it was the Butcher.

622
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:29,445
I think a guy like that

623
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:32,134
should be running the police
force, not hiding from it.

624
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,950
- Is this a lion or a hippo ?
- I think it's a lion.

625
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,722
Tastes like a hippo.

626
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,695
- Animal cracker ?
- No, thank you.

627
00:38:43,351 --> 00:38:45,819
What do you do for a living,
Mr. Olson ?

628
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,887
I just lost my job.

629
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:49,646
That's too bad.

630
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,475
I see that you have
a minor assault record

631
00:38:53,694 --> 00:38:55,491
and no alibi for yesterday morning.

632
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,957
I'm sure my client didn't
realize he needed one.

633
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:00,201
You have a girlfriend, Mr. Olson ?

634
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,260
She just broke up with me.
Why, you interested ?

635
00:39:03,613 --> 00:39:04,847
Just curious.

636
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,609
Now, this is a lion.

637
00:39:08,572 --> 00:39:11,131
Alright, let me keep this all straight.

638
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:12,734
No job,

639
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,417
no relationship.

640
00:39:14,829 --> 00:39:16,930
You got guns
and a minor assault record.

641
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:21,118
- And I voted for Bush both times.
- Sorry, were you getting at something ?

642
00:39:21,153 --> 00:39:25,018
What he's getting at, Mr. Novik,
is your client fits the 4-point profile

643
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:29,032
of someone who'd commit a vigilante
offense. You're a ticking time bomb.

644
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:33,405
You ask me, you just needed a reason
to take the law into your own hands.

645
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,685
And the butcher
was the perfect excuse.

646
00:39:35,943 --> 00:39:38,572
- You don't know me.
- We know you attacked John Henry.

647
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:41,774
You need proof to make those
kinds of accusations, detective.

648
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,861
You heard the man, detective.
We've got work to do.

649
00:39:46,663 --> 00:39:50,410
Make yourself comfortable, Mr. Olson.
We're just getting started with you.

650
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:02,691
<i>That's my marina.</i>

651
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:06,915
<i>And in less than 30 minutes,
I'll be on that screen.</i>

652
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:10,723
<i>I need to take care of this,
and fast.</i>

653
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,330
<i>I'm out of time.</i>

654
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,403
<i>I need an idea, a sign,</i>

655
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,637
<i>anything.</i>

656
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:19,929
<i>What would the old Dexter do ?</i>

657
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:25,577
<i>Definitely not that.</i>

658
00:40:28,312 --> 00:40:29,771
<i>No security cameras.</i>

659
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,760
<i>Apparently the new Dexter's stuck
in high school.</i>

660
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,620
<i>Maybe I am a late bloomer.</i>

661
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,205
A fire drill ? Are you kidding ?
We have work to do.

662
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:51,736
It's probably one of those kids
in the bullpen.

663
00:40:52,022 --> 00:40:54,161
It's something I would have done.

664
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,062
Well, at least it stopped raining.

665
00:41:18,882 --> 00:41:20,384
All clear. Everybody out.

666
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:22,810
All clear ! Everybody out !

667
00:41:25,271 --> 00:41:26,648
Respect the vest.

668
00:41:26,846 --> 00:41:28,921
Don't make me take out my hose.

669
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,447
<i>Like it never happened.</i>

670
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,103
<i>If only the rest of life
were so easy to figure out.</i>

671
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:47,938
Where you headed ?

672
00:41:48,078 --> 00:41:50,002
I figured you'd be 1st
to ogle the firemen.

673
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:53,472
I have to arrange protective custody
for that fucking train-car victim.

674
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,692
- Why ?
- 'Cause we have nothing on Olson,

675
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:58,440
not even enough to get a warrant
to search his place.

676
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:00,196
Is that Olson's file ?

677
00:42:01,571 --> 00:42:04,120
If we don't get something soon,
Lundy'll have to let him go,

678
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:06,200
meaning Olson will kill again,

679
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:08,931
meaning we lose
the Butcher case to the FBI,

680
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:11,299
- meaning we're fucked.
- Some more than others.

681
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,777
No shit. Till Lundy showed up,

682
00:42:13,956 --> 00:42:16,802
I felt like the dipshit who
slept with the ice-Truck killer.

683
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:19,964
If he pulls the plug, I go back
to being the resident retard.

684
00:42:20,311 --> 00:42:21,640
Chin up little sister,

685
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:24,307
these things have a way
of working themselves out.

686
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,603
<i>I just have to find
a piece of evidence</i>

687
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,607
<i>to make sure Lundy
catches Olson fair and square.</i>

688
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:19,587
<i>Looks like I have a fan club,
membership of one.</i>

689
00:43:37,644 --> 00:43:39,693
Why you so interested in the Butcher ?

690
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:41,517
Who the fuck are you ?

691
00:43:42,221 --> 00:43:44,510
Holy shit, you're him, aren't you ?

692
00:43:44,778 --> 00:43:47,493
Stop. Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

693
00:43:48,113 --> 00:43:50,724
I'm like you. I take out criminals.

694
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:53,063
You mean you try... pitifully.

695
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:55,724
No, that was just the last one.

696
00:43:55,912 --> 00:43:56,962
He got away.

697
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,216
I should have never made it personal.

698
00:43:59,377 --> 00:44:01,808
- You've killed others ?
- That's I'm telling you.

699
00:44:02,198 --> 00:44:05,435
First was a drug dealer -
I ran him down with my car.

700
00:44:05,848 --> 00:44:08,602
It felt... It felt fucking great,

701
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,888
Even better than the free stash
I got off him.

702
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:14,255
And then, this guy at work

703
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:17,772
found out I was fucking his wife.
He started to beat on her,

704
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:20,038
so I pushed him down a stairwell.

705
00:44:20,228 --> 00:44:23,321
The cops thought it was
an accident, but it was me.

706
00:44:24,252 --> 00:44:26,183
See, you can't kill me.

707
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:27,917
I wasn't going to...

708
00:44:31,408 --> 00:44:32,408
until now.

709
00:44:45,024 --> 00:44:47,695
This is what the kill room
should look like.

710
00:44:48,342 --> 00:44:50,488
the inside of a big plastic bag.

711
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:55,859
Of course, I spent hours working
in this train car yesterday,

712
00:44:56,038 --> 00:44:58,613
so I'm not too worried
about trace evidence.

713
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,742
To your credit,
your location was well chosen.

714
00:45:02,942 --> 00:45:06,108
It just needed
a little cleaning, a few lights,

715
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:08,039
proper tools, of course.

716
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:11,485
- I did it because of you.
- No.

717
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,384
You attacked those people
because you wanted to.

718
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,647
- You inspired me...
- I didn't.

719
00:45:17,826 --> 00:45:20,267
- ... with your principles.
- They're not mine.

720
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:23,041
- Of course they are !
- Don't tell me who I am.

721
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:27,168
All my life, I've done what
someone else said I should do,

722
00:45:27,346 --> 00:45:30,614
been who he said I should be. I followed
his rules, I stuck to his plan.

723
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,315
I never stopped to think about
what I wanted and what I needed.

724
00:45:34,938 --> 00:45:37,871
And now I don't know
who I'm supposed to be.

725
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:42,338
I'll tell you one thing, though.
I'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.

726
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,112
I'm certainly not
anybody's role model.

727
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,902
What are you talking about then ?
Who are you ?

728
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:50,191
I'll let you know
when I figure that out.

729
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,290
Though, I got to tell you,

730
00:45:52,545 --> 00:45:54,666
I am well on my way, because...

731
00:45:55,874 --> 00:45:58,359
as sure as I'm standing here,
I don't need to kill you.

732
00:45:58,555 --> 00:45:59,688
That's a relief.

733
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:01,796
I mean that need
that comes from within

734
00:46:01,957 --> 00:46:03,888
that always drives me to this table

735
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,788
I don't feel it.

736
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:11,094
I'm in recovery.

737
00:46:11,404 --> 00:46:15,084
- I knew you weren't gonna kill me.
- No, I will kill you. I have to.

738
00:46:15,704 --> 00:46:18,562
I just don't need to.
It's very empowering.

739
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:48,743
Anyone in there, make yourself known !

740
00:47:01,308 --> 00:47:02,110
Arm.

741
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:03,841
Leg.

742
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:05,429
Head.

743
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:09,899
It's Olson, gift-wrapped.

744
00:47:10,191 --> 00:47:12,605
It would seem the Butcher
is watching us,

745
00:47:12,745 --> 00:47:15,896
- tracking the investigation.
- That wouldn't be too hard to do.

746
00:47:16,156 --> 00:47:18,606
But why'd he leave the victim's
body for us ? It's a 1st.

747
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,333
Probably didn't take too kindly
to the idea of Olson imitating him.

748
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:25,093
It's a good way to
discourage others, don't you think ?

749
00:47:25,273 --> 00:47:27,893
I hate to say it, but he
probably did us a favor.

750
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:31,293
Take the law into your own hands,
the Bay Harbor boogeyman'll get you.

751
00:47:31,523 --> 00:47:33,705
It's the 1st time
we've set foot in a place

752
00:47:33,902 --> 00:47:37,095
where the Bay Harbor Butcher's
actually been. Let's get busy.

753
00:47:44,377 --> 00:47:47,305
- Anybody seen Lundy ?
- Over there on the phone.

754
00:47:47,445 --> 00:47:49,247
He's talking to D.C., I think.

755
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,587
Shit. Is he gonna
pull the case from us ?

756
00:47:57,125 --> 00:48:00,028
Sure, have Robinson call me.
He's got my cell.

757
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:03,912
I came here for privacy,
officer Morgan.

758
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:06,890
- Sorry.
- Too much background noise over there.

759
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,904
Hearing's the first thing to go.

760
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:12,514
- Or is it memory ? I always forget.
- You gonna pull the case from us ?

761
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,904
- You said if anybody died...
- At the hands of a vigilante.

762
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:19,487
This was our killer.
I'm afraid you're still stuck with me.

763
00:48:20,324 --> 00:48:22,596
Will your brother be here tomorrow ?

764
00:48:23,611 --> 00:48:25,131
Yeah, I think so.

765
00:48:26,477 --> 00:48:29,273
I'll tell him you want him
within shouting distance.

766
00:48:30,591 --> 00:48:32,093
What just happened ?

767
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:34,973
No, it's cool. He's always been
the family superstar.

768
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,686
- Who ?
- Dexter, your new go-to guy.

769
00:48:38,668 --> 00:48:42,582
This isn't about Dexter. It's about
Masuka. I can't stand him.

770
00:48:43,817 --> 00:48:46,537
If I hear one more titty joke,
I could punch him in the face.

771
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,664
Really ?

772
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:54,853
<i>Any north unit, request has been made
for 42 escort from Orange belt to J.M.S.</i>

773
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:04,698
Hey.

774
00:49:06,715 --> 00:49:07,860
Come on in.

775
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:10,142
Sit down.

776
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:18,921
I was angry before
when you tried to explain.

777
00:49:19,118 --> 00:49:20,673
This time I'll listen.

778
00:49:24,218 --> 00:49:27,098
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the road trip.

779
00:49:28,571 --> 00:49:29,554
Lila...

780
00:49:32,071 --> 00:49:33,895
came with me to Naples...

781
00:49:34,144 --> 00:49:35,372
as my sponsor.

782
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,786
That's all.

783
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:39,260
Why would you need her in Naples ?

784
00:49:39,549 --> 00:49:41,783
You remember
when I went out of town ?

785
00:49:42,052 --> 00:49:44,502
I went to find the man
who killed my mother.

786
00:49:44,973 --> 00:49:46,780
What are you talking about ?

787
00:49:47,481 --> 00:49:50,099
A lot of stuff has been
coming up for me in recovery,

788
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,299
things I never thought
I'd deal with.

789
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:56,319
I watched my mother die

790
00:49:57,102 --> 00:49:59,221
- when I was 3.
- God.

791
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:03,261
I'm so sorry.

792
00:50:03,532 --> 00:50:04,950
She was murdered

793
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:07,006
in front of me.

794
00:50:07,653 --> 00:50:08,976
I saw it happen.

795
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:14,116
I think that has a lot to do
with why I'm...

796
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:19,134
why I do the things I do.

797
00:50:20,523 --> 00:50:22,937
Of course.
Of course, it makes sense.

798
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:26,755
I found the man who killed her
in Naples.

799
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,517
I thought maybe if I talked to him,
I could find some kind...

800
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:32,559
of closure.

801
00:50:33,776 --> 00:50:36,190
That's why Lila came with me.
For support.

802
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:42,286
- What ?
- This was a huge moment

803
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:44,514
in your life, Dexter...

804
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:47,452
and you chose to include Lila

805
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:49,017
but not me.

806
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:52,427
- She's my sponsor.
- And I'm your girlfriend.

807
00:50:53,033 --> 00:50:55,393
I was afraid
you wouldn't understand.

808
00:51:06,144 --> 00:51:06,985
So...

809
00:51:07,782 --> 00:51:09,503
let me try to understand now.

810
00:51:11,244 --> 00:51:12,380
You and Lila

811
00:51:13,245 --> 00:51:16,616
went away together
as sponsor and sponsee.

812
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:21,849
And you really did have
adjoining rooms.

813
00:51:24,327 --> 00:51:26,115
So you didn't have sex that night ?

814
00:51:34,044 --> 00:51:35,294
Not that night.

815
00:51:41,201 --> 00:51:42,001
Leave.

816
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:44,396
Rita...

817
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:48,782
No, please ! Leave now.

818
00:52:05,764 --> 00:52:08,969
<i>There was a time I would have done
anything to protect Rita.</i>

819
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,243
<i>I would have even lied.</i>

820
00:52:11,584 --> 00:52:13,534
<i>But today I told the truth...</i>

821
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,035
<i>even though I knew she'd get hurt.</i>

822
00:52:27,064 --> 00:52:29,461
<i>Maybe I am leaving
the old me behind.</i>
