1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,739
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:06,846
<i>Two treasure hunters made a ghastly
discovery today,</i>

3
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:09,849
<i>when they found what appears
to be an underwater graveyard</i>

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,639
<i>in a crevice off the coast of Miami.</i>

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,866
It means there might be
a new mass murderer

6
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:18,691
way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.

7
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:20,525
The "Bay Harbor Butcher" ?

8
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:22,904
That's what the press
is calling him.

9
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:25,281
Last thing Miami needs
is another serial killer.

10
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:27,457
13 and counting.

11
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:31,037
They're so swamped up there
they had to bring an outside talent.

12
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,743
Frank Lundy's a rock star.

13
00:00:32,883 --> 00:00:36,160
The green river killer, the D.C. sniper ?
Tough case, but he broke it.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,144
<i>This is the man who stands
between me and death row.</i>

15
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:41,798
With your help,
we'll find whoever did this awful thing.

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,608
So let's get a jump start
on the Bay Harbor Butcher.

17
00:00:44,748 --> 00:00:47,965
<i>With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.</i>

18
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,370
Paul kept insisting to me

19
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:53,175
that you knocked him over the head,

20
00:00:53,524 --> 00:00:56,014
dragged him to his motel
and shut him up with drugs.

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,272
I hit Paul to protect you
and the kids.

22
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:02,077
If there's anything left between us,
you'll answer me this one question

23
00:01:02,217 --> 00:01:04,259
and you will tell me the truth.

24
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:08,507
Are you an addict ?

25
00:01:09,964 --> 00:01:11,832
Yes, I have an addiction.

26
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,178
My name is Caroline.

27
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,431
- I'm an addict.
- Hi, Caroline.

28
00:03:20,102 --> 00:03:22,073
I started taking pain pills

29
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,359
after my back surgery.

30
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,701
I don't need them for the pain
any more.

31
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,406
Now...

32
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,124
Now, I just need them.

33
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:34,622
<i>And I need duct tape, 3 or 4 rolls,</i>

34
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:37,314
<i>running low on
heavy duty trash bags...</i>

35
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:40,479
<i>Until last time,
I sharpened my knives...</i>

36
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:42,404
And then, I lost my license,

37
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:45,511
<i>Tears, now ?
It's very hard to concentrate in here.</i>

38
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:47,863
<i>How am I supposed
to get any work done ?</i>

39
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,027
My husband says
he's gonna leave me

40
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,576
if I don't stay sober.

41
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,628
But I have to do this for myself.

42
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:01,131
<i>"No self control, lost everything,"</i>

43
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,967
<i>"trying to stop".
Same whiney story over and over for...</i>

44
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:07,670
<i>ten minutes...
It feels like 10 hours.</i>

45
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,183
Lortabs, Darvocet...

46
00:04:12,138 --> 00:04:13,286
Percocet,

47
00:04:13,737 --> 00:04:15,976
and anything I could get
my hands on.

48
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,743
Even now...

49
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,851
I'd kill for a Vicodin.

50
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,078
<i>- Lightweight ?
- First hit at narcotics anonymous.</i>

51
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,449
But I don't belong here.

52
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:30,599
You guys are real addicts.

53
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:34,247
So, how was the meeting ?
Tell me everything.

54
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,635
It was... interesting, hearing
the same story over and over again.

55
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:41,110
- Knowing you're not alone.
- Exactly.

56
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,835
- Did you get fortune cookies ?
- Only the ones with the good fortunes.

57
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:47,759
So did you share or just listen ?

58
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,627
I just wanted to take it all
in my 1st time out.

59
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,423
Think they forgot...

60
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:54,643
Here they are ! Spring rolls.

61
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:57,148
What about a sponsor ?
Did you find one ?

62
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:01,148
I didn't want to rush into anything.
It's an important relationship.

63
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,741
Absolutely.

64
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,421
OK, so, let's see
your newcomer's chip.

65
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,716
My newcomer's chip ? Yeah...

66
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:16,373
- You did stay until the end, right ?
- Of course I did, right...

67
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,628
till the end.

68
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,334
You're a terrible liar.

69
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:28,218
I know too much
about 12 steps programs

70
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,617
to be easily conned, Dexter.

71
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,858
I didn't stay till the end-end,
if that's what you mean.

72
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,374
I had some important errands to run.

73
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:39,005
Important ? But... am I important ?

74
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,544
Are the kids ?

75
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,443
Yes, of course.

76
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:47,170
You just gonna have to figure out
how important,

77
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:50,230
'cause if you don't work the program,
and I mean really work it,

78
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,160
I just...
I can't go through this again.

79
00:05:55,718 --> 00:05:57,300
All right, kids. Dinner.

80
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,712
<i>How important are they ?</i>

81
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:02,772
<i>I'm sure someone with a heart
could answer that question.</i>

82
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:12,988
Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow.

83
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:15,869
I'll stay.

84
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:28,310
Hold the elevator !

85
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:36,634
Thanks.

86
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,685
Nice dodge last night,
flooring it through that yellow light.

87
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,177
Were you behind me ?

88
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,400
See you tonight.

89
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,810
... detective will be with you.

90
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,799
<i>How long will we have to...</i>

91
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,683
We will get to all of you.

92
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:59,627
Take their names, and keep them out
of the bullpen, till we figure this out.

93
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:00,976
Sue McMillan !

94
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,938
She disappeared 4 years ago.

95
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:05,590
Who are they ?

96
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,247
Family members of every missing person
for the last decade.

97
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:11,805
Including some sad, lonely
and presumably single woman

98
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,579
courtesy of Lieutenant Pascal.

99
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,438
It's not her fault.
That reporter's an asshole.

100
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:21,035
Sergeant ? Hold the rest of them
downstairs. We're out of room, here.

101
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,253
Have you seen Pascal ?

102
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,392
Pascal is just caught
in a cycle of reaction.

103
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:28,907
She's not co-creating
her own reality.

104
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:31,230
You know those words
don't mean anything, right ?

105
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,807
Look around you.
She's manifesting negativity.

106
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:35,053
It's on again.

107
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,049
<i>- Lieutenant ?
- No comment.</i>

108
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:39,768
<i>Dozens of bodies found</i>

109
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:42,160
<i>- in that underwater grave site.
- Not dozens.</i>

110
00:07:42,302 --> 00:07:44,369
The boss' sweater melons
look bigger on TV.

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,107
The operative word is boss.
Show some respect.

112
00:07:48,077 --> 00:07:49,442
I thought I was.

113
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:51,919
<i>- One dozen, two dozens ?
- 18 or so.</i>

114
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,514
<i>- Excuse me.
- Have the families been notified ?</i>

115
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,416
<i>We're still trying to identify them.</i>

116
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:58,875
<i>Our viewers with information
can contact you ?</i>

117
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,314
<i>Yes. Fine.</i>

118
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:06,079
<i>So police are seeking
any leads that can help them identify</i>

119
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,379
<i>the 18 faceless victims
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.</i>

120
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,073
<i>If you have any information...</i>

121
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:13,334
Pascal is definitely off her game.

122
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,840
Word is, her fiancé is catching
some strange in the sly.

123
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,487
That'd do it.

124
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,832
The shit stops here.
Give it to me.

125
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:26,062
<i>Most of these people
won't find answers here.</i>

126
00:08:26,682 --> 00:08:30,050
<i>Chances are good their loved ones
weren't among my chosen few.</i>

127
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:33,459
May I have your attention, please ?

128
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:36,740
First of all, I wanna tell you
what a great job

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,284
you've all been doing
on this horrific case.

130
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:43,622
And with the help of the best man hunter
in the FBI, we should have answers soon.

131
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,064
In the meantime,
the daily work of this precinct

132
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:49,935
must continue to serve the public.
So, we'll be dividing up our resources.

133
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:53,632
Agent Lundy has requested the following
officers for his joint task force.

134
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:55,216
Officer Cook !

135
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,209
Landy made me L.F.I.

136
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,540
- L.F.I ?
- Lead Forensics Investigator.

137
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:03,898
Sorry you got boned but, hey,
no blood spatter.

138
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,327
It sucks to be me.

139
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,729
<i>Actually, it keeps me off
Lundy's radar.</i>

140
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,321
Sergeant Lee.

141
00:09:10,673 --> 00:09:12,179
Detective Ramos...

142
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,109
Officer Panko.

143
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:19,324
- Detective Batista.
- Yes !

144
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:21,242
I saw this happening.

145
00:09:21,502 --> 00:09:22,911
And officer Debra Morgan.

146
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:28,838
Those called'll report directly
to Special Agent Lundy.

147
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:31,892
But let's not forget
this is on all of us, folks.

148
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:34,090
Let's keep our eyes
and ears open.

149
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:38,021
The Ice Truck Killer was an amateur
compared to this guy.

150
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:43,316
I'd also appreciate it
if your lieutenant would consult with me

151
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,060
before speaking to the press.

152
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,477
I'll rip her a new one,
if I can find her.

153
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,448
<i>Prints, fibers, trace evidence.</i>

154
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,610
<i>No, they won't find anything.</i>

155
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:59,639
<i>I followed all of Harry's
painstaking preventative measures.</i>

156
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,149
<i>He knew that nothing stays
buried forever.</i>

157
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,285
<i>His code will protect me.</i>

158
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:07,008
<i>Still, I wish my own sister
weren't hunting me,</i>

159
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,892
<i>makes for an awkward
family dynamic.</i>

160
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:14,071
So... I'm a fed. My suit proves it.

161
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,958
The other suits here are feds.

162
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:19,096
But, suit or...

163
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:21,272
ugly Hawaiian shirt,

164
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:23,716
no offense,

165
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,576
we're a team.

166
00:10:25,716 --> 00:10:28,289
And our first play is
IDing those bodies.

167
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,318
Once we know who they are, we'll fill in
every detail of their lives.

168
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:35,316
<i>From their huevos rancheros
to their crème brûlée.</i>

169
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:39,673
And... get used to food references
because...

170
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:42,357
I like food.

171
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:46,077
Mr. Masuka and his team're gathering
DNA, prints and dental records.

172
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:49,456
The rest of us are going call through
cold cases and missing persons files.

173
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,333
Also, I want that crowd out there
interviewed.

174
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:54,794
Though most of them'll be
a waste of time.

175
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,463
He has negative thinking.

176
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:59,540
You four, move them out
as quickly as you can.

177
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,372
But be thorough. If we get
even one hit, it'll be worth it.

178
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:06,043
Everyone else work the files.

179
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:09,780
Remember,
IDs will lead to a pattern,

180
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:12,020
which will lead to our man.

181
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:18,875
<i>When the manhunt is on,
the hunted go shopping.</i>

182
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:24,052
<i>Not for a new car.
For my next project.</i>

183
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,393
<i>I won't act on it... yet.</i>

184
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:29,484
<i>I'm still laying low,
Harry would insist on that.</i>

185
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:32,707
<i>Just getting the research
out of the way.</i>

186
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:36,122
<i>Someone talked his way
into the homes of two women</i>

187
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,624
<i>and didn't leave
till they were dead.</i>

188
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,169
<i>Ann Cohen, and a month before her,</i>

189
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:42,491
<i>Lynn Hall.</i>

190
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,795
<i>A certain car dealership
ran credit checks on both women.</i>

191
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:52,185
<i>Both bought cars elsewhere,
so nobody thought about it twice.</i>

192
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:55,647
<i>But who requested
those credit checks ?</i>

193
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,688
<i>Roger Hicks.</i>

194
00:12:02,474 --> 00:12:04,568
<i>All I need is some DNA proof.</i>

195
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:06,931
<i>A cup of coffee should do the trick.</i>

196
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:19,030
How many kids you got ?

197
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,714
Enough...

198
00:12:23,682 --> 00:12:24,884
I hear you.

199
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,236
When my two came along,
it was bye bye convertible.

200
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:29,405
Of course,

201
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:31,824
they're worth it.

202
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:34,813
Must have taken after their mom.

203
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:36,881
That they do. Thank God !

204
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,563
Yeah, I tell you
I miss my convertible but...

205
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:44,221
the truth,
my minivan's got a much nicer ride.

206
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,917
- So, you own one ?
- The same one you're looking at.

207
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:50,910
I know, whipped, right ?
But my kids love

208
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,080
<i>the twin DVDs. They're crazy
about Sponge Bob. You see ?</i>

209
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,124
- Actually, I do.
- My wife loves the NAV system and all

210
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,712
the safety features,
and when they're happy...

211
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,292
- You're happy.
- That's right.

212
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,842
<i>Except the kids
and the wife don't exist.</i>

213
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:08,569
<i>And he owns a Beemer,
not to minivan.</i>

214
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,347
<i>Still, he's seemless.</i>

215
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,308
<i>- Impressive.
- It's not flashy, but...</i>

216
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,708
What did flash ever get me ?
Get me pulled over, that's what.

217
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:18,950
I'm definitely not in the flash.

218
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:21,243
You gotta sit in the captain chair,
though.

219
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:24,081
It's like a 747, man.
Manuel, hold up !

220
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,474
Thank you, sir.

221
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:30,499
So... We should take it out.

222
00:13:30,748 --> 00:13:33,336
- Check out the ride.
- No, I'm just doing research.

223
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:36,023
OK, you don't want
a big sales pitch, I get that.

224
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:38,930
Let me at least pull the specs
for you.

225
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:42,674
Because, truthfully, we have
a hard time keeping these on the lot,

226
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:45,655
you might wanna grab the test drive
while it's still here.

227
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:49,347
I think I have all the information
I need to make a decision.

228
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:52,831
Then, you've seen the Stow&Go
seating system, right ?

229
00:13:54,786 --> 00:13:57,699
I have had everything in here

230
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,235
from a soccer team,

231
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:04,308
to a freaking deer carcass.
It was an accident, of course.

232
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:08,207
But I sure was glad
for the ample cargo space.

233
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:10,619
Not to mention the tainted windows.

234
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:14,019
I can see
how that might come in handy.

235
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:16,894
I'll just grab the keys.

236
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:34,772
<i>I go to stalk a killer
and I end up with a new car...</i>

237
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,988
<i>- How did that happen ?
- New car ?</i>

238
00:14:39,894 --> 00:14:41,643
You're getting married ?

239
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,652
Not that I know of.

240
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:48,376
So what's with the mommy-mobile ?

241
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,655
I'm...

242
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,864
not sure.

243
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,257
Synthetic...

244
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,600
<i>Even Roger's hair is a lie.</i>

245
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:11,493
<i>I could learn a thing or two
from this guy.</i>

246
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,205
Who's your daddy ?

247
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,555
Harry Morgan.

248
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:21,006
Dude, the lead forensics investigator
of the joint task force.

249
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,824
That's who.

250
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,799
- So, you want in on this bitch or not ?
- What bitch ?

251
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:30,962
The only bitch in town, baby.
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

252
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,119
I got you temporarily assigned.

253
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:36,221
- You didn't have to.
- Nothing sexy, of course,

254
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:38,278
just some bone marrow collection
for DNA IDs.

255
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:42,212
But it'll get you in the tent.
And you gotta see the tent. Amazing !

256
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:46,723
Say it.

257
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,049
- You're my daddy.
- It sounds weird when you say it.

258
00:15:52,061 --> 00:15:54,969
I haven't been much use,
since he disappeared.

259
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:58,728
I know I'm supposed to move on...

260
00:15:59,336 --> 00:16:00,239
But...

261
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:02,908
Here's a picture of him.

262
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,244
He looks...

263
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,027
nice.

264
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:11,330
Not according to my mother.

265
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,768
Or the police.
He was in and out of jail.

266
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,404
But...

267
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:20,355
my heart raced whenever I saw him.

268
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:26,180
I brought his toothbrush.
They say you can get DNA off it.

269
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,914
You can find him with this, right ?

270
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:46,841
Look, thanks for choosing me
for the task force and all, but...

271
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:49,224
I'd appreciate
you finding someone else.

272
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:52,884
- You want off ?
- Just as soon as you can replace me, sir.

273
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,603
This is a chance to solve
a pretty important case.

274
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:59,307
Most people get into
this line of work to do just that.

275
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:04,573
I've got cases of my own backing up,

276
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:08,780
and the precinct's shorthanded with all
this shit, so, if you don't mind...

277
00:17:10,211 --> 00:17:11,876
I'll see what I can do.

278
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:15,373
In the meantime,
if you could continue the interviews...

279
00:17:16,443 --> 00:17:17,920
Yeah, of course.

280
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,408
Thank you.

281
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,594
Most of them have been underwater
for years, but some...

282
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:31,580
It's awesome, you can't even tell.

283
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:35,087
The temperature in the ocean floor
and the airtight bags kept them intact.

284
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,606
I mean a little gelatinous residue
sure, but...

285
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:41,834
<i>I'd rather remember my old playmates as
they were. Neat, clean little packages.</i>

286
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:45,982
- I appreciate the favor, Vince, but...
- Actually, you're doing me the favor.

287
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:49,482
I need your help, buddy.
The pressure's fucking ridonkulous.

288
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:51,341
Glad to be of service.

289
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,668
Field morgue, for the overflow,
but it's state of the art.

290
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,323
Fucking FBI, hey ?

291
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:07,138
A good percentage is just bones,

292
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:09,486
Must have fed the fish
when the bags tore.

293
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,520
Humpty fucking Dumpty, right ?

294
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:12,608
<i>Exactly.</i>

295
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,702
<i>They weren't meant
to be put together again.</i>

296
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:18,619
<i>They were meant to remain
in the silent shadows,</i>

297
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:20,893
<i>keeping their secrets.</i>

298
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:23,689
<i>Now, they're exposed to the glare,</i>

299
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:27,821
<i>reflecting my darkness
like some grotesque carnival mirror.</i>

300
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,426
<i>Harry was right.
Nothing stays buried.</i>

301
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,864
<i>Perhaps, not even me.</i>

302
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:44,714
<i>Looking for my Taurus, Sergeant ?</i>

303
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:46,845
<i>Keep looking.</i>

304
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:49,769
<i>You don't need to know
where I'm going tonight.</i>

305
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:52,637
... and, genius me,

306
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:55,665
not only do I leave my works
in my girlfriend's car,

307
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,845
but also all the dead fish
from the fishing trip, right ?

308
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:03,520
Then I collapse
in her parents' house,

309
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:07,548
scare her kids, and get myself
fired, 'cause guess what...

310
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:09,114
We work together.

311
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,296
So now,

312
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:17,971
I'm 20 day sober,

313
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:19,729
again,

314
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:22,679
hoping to make it to 21.

315
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:29,821
Thanks, Gordon.

316
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,460
This meeting recognizes
lengths of sobriety

317
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,263
with chips.

318
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:36,755
So...

319
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:40,830
If there's anyone who'd like
a newcomer's chip...

320
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,926
You've got 3 minutes to share
if you want it.

321
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:55,211
Really ?

322
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:57,241
Go ahead.
You among friends.

323
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,501
Well, I...

324
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,258
What's your name ?

325
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:19,348
Hi, Bob.

326
00:20:21,724 --> 00:20:23,282
And I'm a...

327
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:25,862
an addict.

328
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:27,813
I use...

329
00:20:29,118 --> 00:20:30,132
heroine.

330
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:32,038
Shoot it.

331
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,873
It's affecting my job.
My boss found my works. He fired my ass.

332
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,695
But I showed him. I spent every penny
on my final paycheck on junk.

333
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,275
And doctor said I...

334
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:55,566
I almost died.

335
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,348
Coffee sucks.

336
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:07,536
As bad as the doughnuts.

337
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,260
It's better next door. Come on.

338
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:23,111
It is good coffee. Thank you.

339
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:27,346
So tell me...

340
00:21:28,426 --> 00:21:29,525
exactly...

341
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:31,798
how full of shit are you ?

342
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,288
I'm not full of anything.

343
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:40,490
It was a nice performance in there.

344
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,838
Where did you download it ?
From Addict.com ?

345
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:47,932
Look, I have no reason to lie.

346
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,885
Sure you do.

347
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,247
We all do.

348
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,906
- You thought I was lying ?
- I don't know...

349
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:01,000
Well, it is anonymous.

350
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,778
Everyone in that room,
has heard or lived

351
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:07,558
far worse
than anything you've ever done.

352
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:10,475
I doubt it.

353
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,808
So, you're super-junky.

354
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:18,584
I don't mean to imply that what you've
been through hasn't been difficult.

355
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:23,279
But there is no way that I could know
what you've experienced, right ?

356
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,477
I couldn't possibly

357
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:30,730
feel that need.

358
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,270
Like a thousand hiding voices

359
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,025
whispering...

360
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,936
"This is who you are..."

361
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:46,056
And you fight the pressure.

362
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:50,332
The growing need rising like a wave.

363
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:54,890
Prickling and teasing
and prodding...

364
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,761
to be fed.

365
00:22:57,892 --> 00:22:59,991
But the whispering gets louder,

366
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,822
until it's screaming "Now !".

367
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,484
And it's the only voice

368
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:08,812
you hear.

369
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,905
The only voice you want to hear.

370
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,107
And you belong to her.

371
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:21,717
To this...

372
00:23:22,572 --> 00:23:24,759
shadow self.

373
00:23:27,426 --> 00:23:28,431
To this...

374
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:33,535
Dark passenger.

375
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,310
The dark passenger.

376
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:53,646
I'm sorry, but...

377
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,674
I need to go.

378
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,493
Thanks for the coffee.

379
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:06,371
<i>She knows.</i>

380
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,900
<i>She recognizes demons,</i>

381
00:24:11,257 --> 00:24:12,928
<i>dark passengers...</i>

382
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:17,064
<i>Maybe the others can too.
This program is too risky.</i>

383
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:18,534
<i>Especially now.</i>

384
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:21,111
<i>Rita will have to understand.</i>

385
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:43,895
You just missed story time.

386
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,745
I was at a meeting.

387
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,154
Thank you.

388
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:55,717
It made me realize
something important.

389
00:24:56,008 --> 00:24:57,604
Really ? What's that ?

390
00:24:58,158 --> 00:25:00,543
Those meetings
are not a good place for me.

391
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:07,082
I know how this sounds,
but I can do this on my own.

392
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,945
- You need a program.
- I've read studies,

393
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:13,038
people are ten times as likely
to change on their own as they are

394
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:16,913
- with the help of doctors or programs.
- So, you're quoting studies ?

395
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:18,793
I lived this.

396
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:21,962
I watched Paul try and fail
with white-knuckle sobriety.

397
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:24,803
I'm not Paul.
I'm not any of those people.

398
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:28,345
Going to those meetings, will do
more arm than good. I swear to you.

399
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:29,973
I'm better off, alone.

400
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,816
I pray you change your mind.

401
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,125
What just happened ?

402
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:10,317
I though you were staying at Rita's.

403
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:14,618
I'm taking the night off.

404
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:20,227
I though you'd be on the treadmill.

405
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:22,931
Taking the night off.

406
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:28,040
<i>With no money down, guaranteed,
or we'll make your first two payments...</i>

407
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:32,389
<i>A night off is good
to remember what's important.</i>

408
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,789
<i>Two women are dead.
The killer is selling minivans</i>

409
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:50,470
<i>and I have an opportunity to prove it.
Even if I am laying low.</i>

410
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:54,254
<i>Having a victim prepped and ready
will take the edge off the wait...</i>

411
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:55,535
<i>I hope.</i>

412
00:26:55,675 --> 00:26:57,225
Hang on a second, OK ?

413
00:26:57,478 --> 00:26:59,234
What's going on, Dex ?

414
00:26:59,501 --> 00:27:02,132
Any problems, the service center
can take care of you,

415
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:05,823
- but they're around the corner.
- Actually, the minivan's fine.

416
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:07,635
Yes, I'd never sell a lemon.

417
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:11,540
- I'm rethinking the extended warranty.
- I'll ask the warranty writer.

418
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:13,987
I'm thinking roof rack
and premium sound system.

419
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:15,495
Going all out.

420
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:18,140
That's great.
But I'm with a customer and so...

421
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:20,435
One of my associates
will take care of you.

422
00:27:20,589 --> 00:27:22,755
I'll just wait for you
in your office.

423
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:36,380
<i>DNA, DNA, come out and play.</i>

424
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:46,309
Roger's got you in a box. Once you're in
a box you don't leave without a deal.

425
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:51,261
Don't worry, you're safe with Roger,
he's the best.

426
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:54,764
I'm just dropping off
this thank you note.

427
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:56,245
I was just leaving.

428
00:27:56,818 --> 00:27:59,037
He sent you across the street,
didn't he ?

429
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:02,882
- Across the street ?
- he told me not to tell anyone too.

430
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:04,664
I don't know how he makes a living

431
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:07,249
sending all of his commissions
to other dealers.

432
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,849
Maybe he has ulterior motives.

433
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,669
Or maybe he knows
I can't afford this price.

434
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,787
After he ran a credit check ?

435
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:15,724
TRW doesn't lie.

436
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,451
So, you're single ?

437
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:23,919
Makes it tougher to afford
those big ticket items like cars...

438
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:25,883
houses. You rent an apartment ?

439
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:28,625
A house. I hate sharing walls,
you hear everything.

440
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:31,045
Tell me about it.
No pets though, right ?

441
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,700
Is this a come-on ?
'Cause it's a little weird.

442
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,728
Must be why I'm still single.

443
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:40,481
<i>Another brunette.</i>

444
00:28:42,115 --> 00:28:44,753
<i>Single, neighbors out of distance.</i>

445
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,100
<i>No guard dog.</i>

446
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,596
<i>The credit check gives Roger
all the details he needs.</i>

447
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:53,342
<i>She's next.</i>

448
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:58,414
<i>And I can't do anything about it.
Not until this manhunt ends.</i>

449
00:28:59,062 --> 00:29:00,757
<i>Harry would insist on it.</i>

450
00:29:08,108 --> 00:29:09,108
What ?

451
00:29:10,564 --> 00:29:11,751
I'll take care of it.

452
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:15,503
I know the card is in his name.
I just wanna check the charges.

453
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:19,820
Well this supervisor I spoke with
this morning allowed it.

454
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,174
Yeah, I'll hold. Yes ?

455
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:30,146
Just to remind you that the Biscayne
drive-by warrant needs your approval.

456
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:31,345
I'll look at it.

457
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,621
And the homicide
that came in last night

458
00:29:33,761 --> 00:29:35,997
still need to be assigned.
Right. Thanks.

459
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:45,470
I know things are awful with your fiancé
right know, and I'm sorry.

460
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:48,482
But we need to keep
clearing that board out there.

461
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:50,222
You're right, I'm sorry.

462
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:54,607
I seem to have had
my head up my ass, lately.

463
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:56,484
It's called being human.

464
00:29:58,431 --> 00:29:59,588
OK, who's up ?

465
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:03,276
- Samuels and Kent are up.
- Put them on the liquor store shooting.

466
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,529
And where is the Biscayne warrant ?

467
00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:08,298
Right here.

468
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,295
Simps and Hoagy
want SWAT for entry ?

469
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:14,357
I think it's a good cautionary
measure given the weapon charge.

470
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:16,619
Excuse me, I'm gonna need a minute.

471
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,362
Just gonna need a minute.

472
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:29,902
I'll handle it.

473
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,748
You're not taking my calls

474
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:42,248
and now you're checking
my credit card charges ?

475
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:48,208
<i>Roger's DNA matches
the semen found at both crime scenes.</i>

476
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,052
<i>Irrefutable.</i>

477
00:30:51,582 --> 00:30:53,969
<i>If I do nothing,
another woman dies.</i>

478
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,816
<i>Is that my long-dormant
conscience talking ?</i>

479
00:30:59,878 --> 00:31:02,270
<i>Or the dark passenger whispering ?</i>

480
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,050
Hi, it's me.

481
00:31:13,726 --> 00:31:14,858
Hi, Dexter.

482
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,253
<i>Kids home from school yet ?</i>

483
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:20,171
Colleen's bringing them home now.

484
00:31:20,469 --> 00:31:21,408
I'm a...

485
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:24,568
little confused.

486
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:26,972
I'm sorry you're confused.

487
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,357
<i>It is pizza night,
shall I pick up the usual ?</i>

488
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:33,110
Did you go back ?

489
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,926
To a meeting ? Thinking about it.

490
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,279
The kids and I will order in, then.

491
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:44,816
So...

492
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:48,774
This is it ?

493
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,106
It's up to you, Dexter.

494
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,087
I want to know where is she.

495
00:31:59,692 --> 00:32:01,768
<i>Mí Teresita, she's so young.</i>

496
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:03,987
Seven-year old.

497
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:05,970
You heard me.

498
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,963
- I know you find her.
- We'll do what we can.

499
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:11,816
Don't cry.

500
00:32:17,037 --> 00:32:18,503
Only English. Angel !

501
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,323
Just tell her we'll call her.

502
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:32,049
She thinks you can find
her daughter.

503
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:35,182
But there are no kids down there.

504
00:32:35,948 --> 00:32:37,699
Tell her I can't help her.

505
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:39,877
I can't help you.

506
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:57,899
It's been 24 hours
since I asked to be replaced.

507
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:58,932
Has it ?

508
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:00,837
What's taking so long ?

509
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:05,254
Every cop on the damn force wants in
on this case, just take your pick.

510
00:33:06,536 --> 00:33:08,905
I've been wondering about that,
actually.

511
00:33:09,748 --> 00:33:11,354
Everyone wants on but

512
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:12,950
you want off.

513
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:15,491
I told you I've cases.

514
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:18,877
I don't think so.

515
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,312
Jesus, I just don't wanna be
on your task force, alright ?

516
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:25,949
Why ?

517
00:33:26,191 --> 00:33:29,857
Because I'm the last person
in the world that should be on it.

518
00:33:30,212 --> 00:33:34,535
You want me to find a serial killer ?
I was engaged to one, for Christ's sake !

519
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,285
What kind of cop...

520
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,728
- What kind...
- That's why I chose you, you know.

521
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:41,939
Because of what you went through.

522
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:43,629
You survived.

523
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:46,250
I don't know how.

524
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:48,813
I can't begin to imagine
the strength it took,

525
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:50,472
continues to take.

526
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:52,858
More than that,

527
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:57,346
you got a first-hand look
into the mind and heart of a killer.

528
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,700
And you're still here.

529
00:34:02,246 --> 00:34:04,793
If you can accept that,
really accept it,

530
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,054
you could use it.

531
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:11,546
Mix that
with some of your strength and...

532
00:34:12,173 --> 00:34:15,597
you could catch someone
even worse than the Ice-Truck Killer.

533
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,881
But you have to stop running.

534
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:26,718
Finish today's interviews.

535
00:34:28,764 --> 00:34:30,637
Then if you still want out,

536
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:31,899
you got it.

537
00:34:38,891 --> 00:34:40,632
Lead fucking investigator.

538
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:42,500
Translation: everyone's bitch.

539
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,536
I do have a life, you know.

540
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:45,840
You do ?

541
00:34:46,636 --> 00:34:49,179
Just give me a bone marrow
DNA results.

542
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:51,189
No matches.

543
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:53,091
Big surprise.

544
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:55,327
Do me a favor
on your way out, OK ?

545
00:34:55,558 --> 00:34:59,249
Drop these dental X-rays at the morgue
for me. Tech should still be there.

546
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:02,835
Fucking Bay Harbor butcher's
butchering my online social life.

547
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:06,668
Sorry.

548
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:21,908
I figured you'd still be here.

549
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:26,338
You were a pain in the ass,
but always a damn hard worker.

550
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:29,572
And of course,
you knew how to handle the press.

551
00:35:31,612 --> 00:35:33,097
Come here a minute.

552
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:47,882
The public needs to believe that we can
protect them when all hell breaks loose,

553
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,783
so I need all my people
operating at their highest levels.

554
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:51,910
I agree.

555
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:55,078
Should I be worried about Pascal ?

556
00:35:58,129 --> 00:35:58,874
Why ?

557
00:36:00,118 --> 00:36:02,017
You can cut the crap, Maria.

558
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,677
I know she's been AWOL
on personal matters.

559
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,551
The press fuck up is huge.

560
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:09,767
And I'm beginning to hear rumors
about erratic behavior.

561
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:13,826
- You're asking me because ?
- Because you've done the job.

562
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:16,705
So she is out,
that means you're back in.

563
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:20,025
That makes you her harshest critic
and I want it straight.

564
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:23,669
Take your shot.

565
00:36:25,648 --> 00:36:27,479
You know what "erratic" means ?

566
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,682
It's code, for non male.

567
00:36:31,485 --> 00:36:35,697
This is the same bullshit sexism
I put up with when I was in charge.

568
00:36:36,598 --> 00:36:40,162
I won't dignify rumors, captain.
Pascal's fine.

569
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:50,872
Minivan's that way.

570
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:54,321
Field morgue's this way.

571
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:55,836
I'll wait.

572
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:58,637
You should take the night off,
sergeant.

573
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,806
On pizza night ? No way.

574
00:37:03,296 --> 00:37:06,219
What's that girlfriend of yours
seeing in a freakshow like you anyway ?

575
00:37:06,404 --> 00:37:08,649
- You have to ask her.
- Maybe I will.

576
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:16,689
What exactly is it
you think I've done ?

577
00:37:16,948 --> 00:37:19,586
I know you're connected
to the Ice-Truck Killer.

578
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:23,125
- Could you be more vague ?
- I know you're too careful.

579
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,771
Your assets are all in cash,

580
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:27,564
you don't belong to any organizations
or alumni groups.

581
00:37:27,738 --> 00:37:31,984
You were top of your class in med school
but you changed for blood spatter.

582
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,341
I know you studied martial arts
in college.

583
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:37,961
But I don't know what a lab geek needs
with advanced Jiu-Jitsu.

584
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:40,591
Do you know what an easy credit is ?

585
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,511
I know you're a good liar too.

586
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:49,636
Not good enough.

587
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:08,173
<i>Sergeant Doakes
thinks he knows my secrets.</i>

588
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,484
<i>But he only needs to look at this,</i>

589
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:12,116
<i>my body of work,</i>

590
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:16,076
<i>- to know the real me.
- Suit up if you gonna touch them.</i>

591
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:23,084
I'm just dropping off some X-rays.

592
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:27,423
- I'm Dexter Morgan.
- I know who you are.

593
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:30,015
Right.

594
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:35,032
Looks like the lab tech's gone home
for the night, so I'll just...

595
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:43,327
You hoping they'll talk to you ?

596
00:38:43,702 --> 00:38:45,234
The ones with heads, anyway.

597
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:50,339
They always speak, eventually.

598
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:56,562
Just gotta ask the right question.

599
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,907
Which is ?

600
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:03,712
Why were they chosen ?

601
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,913
Looking for a pattern ?

602
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,715
One doesn't kill
this many people in this...

603
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:12,512
careful, methodical way
without a reason.

604
00:39:13,473 --> 00:39:16,181
Some... twisted set of principles.

605
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:21,590
They would have to be twisted,
wouldn't they ?

606
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:23,607
The worst killers
are usually the ones

607
00:39:23,792 --> 00:39:26,284
who think their murders
were somehow... just.

608
00:39:26,672 --> 00:39:27,878
Even deserved.

609
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:33,012
Leaders have slaughtered whole
populations for the same wacky reason.

610
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,927
But there's never any justification
for killing.

611
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,293
Well, one, of course.

612
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,228
To save an innocent life.

613
00:39:48,149 --> 00:39:50,026
To save an innocent life.

614
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:55,370
<i>How many more bodies would there be,
had I not stopped those killers ?</i>

615
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,900
<i>I didn't do it to save lives.</i>

616
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:01,327
<i>But save lives, I did.</i>

617
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,618
<i>Motivation aside,</i>

618
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:07,596
<i>I think Harry and Lundy
would agree on this one.</i>

619
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:19,866
Roger the artful dodger.

620
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,110
You scared me, bro.

621
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,404
We have some unfinished business.

622
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:26,577
Right, the warranty and stuff.

623
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:29,755
Listen, I can't write you up now,
the wife's waiting for me.

624
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:31,132
Not married.

625
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:33,609
- Ex, I gotta take the kids.
- You don't have any.

626
00:40:33,794 --> 00:40:35,555
- They're hers.
- Nope.

627
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:37,335
OK, what about this one ?

628
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,008
I don't give a shit !

629
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:44,352
Neither do I.

630
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:56,462
You were right
about the ample cargo space.

631
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:14,559
Where am I ?

632
00:41:19,983 --> 00:41:23,853
Looks different under plastic
but you've spent an evening here.

633
00:41:24,854 --> 00:41:26,207
With Ann Cohen.

634
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,714
You took her last breath from her right
over there, you remember ?

635
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:33,874
You're wrong, I wouldn't !

636
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:35,799
No, you would, and you did

637
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:38,699
and you're about to do it again,
that's why we're here.

638
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:40,390
No, this is crazy.

639
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,745
You've got the wrong guy, I...

640
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:45,070
I sell cars, for God's sake.

641
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,809
I've never hurt anyone in my life,
definitely not a woman.

642
00:41:48,024 --> 00:41:50,158
- Why can't I do that ?
- Do what ?

643
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:51,743
Lie like that.

644
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:55,485
When I thought I was good,
but you, it's...

645
00:41:56,654 --> 00:41:57,762
I don't lie !

646
00:41:58,692 --> 00:42:00,153
OK, that one was weak.

647
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:01,511
Hey, look.

648
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:03,751
Any car in the lot, it's yours.

649
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:08,374
T- bird, town car, you name it.
Yours. Free. I'll call it in right now.

650
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,516
- Lot's closed.
- I'll have it opened. I'm the manager.

651
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:14,944
- The manager is Rick Boxton.
- But I've been there longer than him.

652
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:18,168
- You've been there 3 months.
- At the other lot.

653
00:42:21,228 --> 00:42:23,248
It's like watching
someone ski moguls.

654
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:27,563
You just hop from one lie to the next,
no shame, no embarrassment, you just

655
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:29,486
don't give a shit.

656
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:35,560
That's the key, right ?
Not to care about anyone

657
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,015
- or anything.
- I care.

658
00:42:39,939 --> 00:42:42,463
- I care a lot.
- It was a compliment.

659
00:42:43,387 --> 00:42:45,787
- I don't care either.
- Yes, you do.

660
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,748
- Like about your wife.
- Not married.

661
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,286
Girlfriend, then.

662
00:42:51,562 --> 00:42:54,270
I saw it the minute
you walked on the lot.

663
00:42:57,634 --> 00:42:59,456
What did you see ? Tell me.

664
00:43:00,874 --> 00:43:03,423
Most guys of your age,
they beeline...

665
00:43:03,672 --> 00:43:07,491
Right through the horse power.
You know, something flashy, sexy.

666
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:10,093
But you, you there all alone,

667
00:43:10,677 --> 00:43:12,326
no one there to nag you,

668
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,981
and you don't even glance
at the coupes.

669
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,706
The only thing you look at
is the minivan.

670
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:21,552
Like you can see her
in the passenger seat,

671
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:25,218
- and the kids in the back.
- Leave the kids out.

672
00:43:25,784 --> 00:43:28,476
You're lying to yourself
if you think you don't care.

673
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:33,174
She's just a companion really.

674
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,117
It started that way, anyway.

675
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:40,093
Someone who...

676
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:43,044
looked good, normal.

677
00:43:43,541 --> 00:43:46,358
- They worm their way in.
- Yeah, they do.

678
00:43:47,484 --> 00:43:49,106
And they shut you out.

679
00:43:54,725 --> 00:43:57,607
That's what this is about ?
That she shut you out ?

680
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:00,112
OK, I get it.

681
00:44:01,512 --> 00:44:02,758
I've been there.

682
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:07,212
But you can't let her
get to you like this.

683
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,131
'cause they're all the same.

684
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,269
Fucking bitches.

685
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:15,432
You do everything for them, and then
they fuck you. She's not worth it !

686
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:17,253
You're better off
without that cunt !

687
00:44:21,156 --> 00:44:23,648
Don't talk that way
about my girlfriend.

688
00:44:28,818 --> 00:44:29,957
I'm Dexter.

689
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,112
and...

690
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:35,128
- I'm not sure of what I am.
- Hi, Dexter.

691
00:44:35,982 --> 00:44:38,767
I just know there is something dark

692
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,379
in me.

693
00:44:42,321 --> 00:44:43,537
And I hide it.

694
00:44:46,028 --> 00:44:48,121
I certainly don't talk about it.

695
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:50,751
It's there,

696
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,660
always.

697
00:44:55,566 --> 00:44:57,292
This dark passenger.

698
00:44:58,537 --> 00:45:00,981
And when he's driving, I feel...

699
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,592
Alive.

700
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:09,393
Half sick with the thrill,
the complete wrongness...

701
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:14,744
I don't fight him. I don't want to.

702
00:45:18,026 --> 00:45:19,394
He's all I've got.

703
00:45:21,408 --> 00:45:23,085
Nothing else could love me.

704
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:24,487
Not even...

705
00:45:27,176 --> 00:45:28,656
especially not me.

706
00:45:32,734 --> 00:45:34,350
Or is that just a lie

707
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:36,796
the dark passenger tells me ?

708
00:45:41,836 --> 00:45:44,888
Because lately, there are
these moments when I feel

709
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,459
connected,

710
00:45:51,664 --> 00:45:53,074
to something else.

711
00:45:53,781 --> 00:45:54,665
Someone.

712
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,157
It's like

713
00:46:01,203 --> 00:46:02,818
the mask is slipping.

714
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,695
Things,

715
00:46:12,115 --> 00:46:13,058
people,

716
00:46:15,388 --> 00:46:18,926
who never mattered before
are suddenly starting to matter.

717
00:46:21,314 --> 00:46:23,341
It scares the hell out of me.

718
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:52,762
Hello.

719
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:05,917
That's all the time we have
for sharing.

720
00:47:07,031 --> 00:47:09,833
Would someone lead us
in the serenity prayer ?

721
00:47:27,189 --> 00:47:29,851
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

722
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,400
The secrets, the sneaking around...

723
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:35,083
Now it all makes sense.

724
00:47:38,204 --> 00:47:40,452
A lot of cops been where you are.

725
00:47:41,813 --> 00:47:43,441
The booze, the drugs.

726
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:46,238
It makes the job go down easier.

727
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,225
Stay clean and stay out of my way.
And we won't have a problem.

728
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:56,908
And you owe me a new Michelin,
you motherfucker.

729
00:48:07,286 --> 00:48:10,759
I have all your forms so we'll do
what we can to bring your dad home.

730
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:12,866
I'm sorry, you don't understand.

731
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:14,767
I don't want him home.

732
00:48:14,968 --> 00:48:17,492
Just tell me he's dead.
We need to know he's gone.

733
00:48:17,677 --> 00:48:19,479
Alright. You want closure.

734
00:48:20,672 --> 00:48:23,938
I want peace.
He made our lives a living hell.

735
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:26,676
When he'd go to prison,
it was a blessing, but...

736
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:29,022
you kept letting him out.

737
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:33,173
I need to tell my mother,
my sister that they're safe.

738
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:37,208
That he's rotting in hell.
Call me when you can tell me that.

739
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,682
Lundy, wait !

740
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,877
I think...
it could be a coincidence but,

741
00:49:00,352 --> 00:49:01,814
there are 2 of them.

742
00:49:02,413 --> 00:49:03,336
Two ?

743
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:06,341
Missing people with records,
prison records.

744
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:09,594
Interesting.

745
00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:14,877
And who typically
has a prison record ?

746
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:18,165
I don't know.

747
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:21,068
Bad guys ?

748
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:23,815
Bad guys.

749
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:28,431
- Do you think it could be...
- A pattern ? Maybe.

750
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,485
We'll run all the victims' DNA
against the criminal database.

751
00:49:32,685 --> 00:49:34,010
DC lab is still open.

752
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:38,118
Come on. Let's get to work.

753
00:49:54,628 --> 00:49:55,869
Dexter, what ?

754
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,921
You were right. I'm sorry...

755
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:00,870
to wake you up, but I had
to let you know that you were right.

756
00:50:01,054 --> 00:50:03,177
- About what ?
- The program...

757
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:05,246
It's...

758
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,234
It's good, it's really good.

759
00:50:10,101 --> 00:50:10,826
I...

760
00:50:12,101 --> 00:50:13,823
am always so in my head.

761
00:50:14,933 --> 00:50:16,421
But this, it was...

762
00:50:17,832 --> 00:50:18,636
good.

763
00:50:21,406 --> 00:50:23,808
In fact it's already helped me
a lot.

764
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,073
Thank you.

765
00:50:38,364 --> 00:50:39,867
I do love this car.

766
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,308
I thought you might.

767
00:50:46,468 --> 00:50:48,515
So, I will pick you up in an hour.

768
00:50:48,952 --> 00:50:51,229
We'll go some place nice for lunch.

769
00:50:52,606 --> 00:50:54,824
- Here's my sponsor.
- Really ? Where ?

770
00:50:55,956 --> 00:50:57,417
The guy in the blue shirt ?

771
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,204
No, next to him. Laila.

772
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:14,643
I'm back.
