1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,057
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:05,214
- Sorry.
- It doesn't change the fact

3
00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:07,160
that you slept with another woman.

4
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,076
What do they have on me ?

5
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:11,428
- They found something in your car.
- Shit.

6
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,112
Our primary suspect
is someone you know well.

7
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:18,276
- Sergeant James Doakes.
- He had the slides.

8
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:21,730
- You know me. That's not me.
- Don't you disappear on me.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,442
What exactly is sergeant Doakes'
problem with you, Morgan ?

10
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:29,801
I always sensed there was something...
off about him.

11
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:33,196
From here on out, we'll want
a protective detail on you at all times.

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,891
You're a good cop like your old man.

13
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:39,357
- Do you think they know ?
- Not until you tell them.

14
00:00:39,657 --> 00:00:41,041
He is not your man.

15
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:44,753
He may be your ex-partner
and best friend. To me, he's a suspect.

16
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,648
- What are you doing here ?
- She came to see me.

17
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:50,050
Are you pissed or something
about Lila and me ?

18
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:52,613
- Lila's just using you to get at me.
- So what ?

19
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,681
<i>A secret cabin
in the middle of the Everglades,</i>

20
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,809
<i>What more could a rededicated
serial killer ask for ?</i>

21
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:04,120
You're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

22
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:18,506
You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan !

23
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:23,584
You're gonna have
to fucking kill me, Morgan !

24
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:34,630
Is it deep ?
I hope it's fucking deep.

25
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:38,578
It's a graze wound.
Minor tissue abrasion.

26
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:42,740
No hemorrhage along the bullet track.
Sorry. I think I'm gonna live.

27
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:45,368
Am I ?

28
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,260
That's a good question.

29
00:03:47,931 --> 00:03:51,332
If you're not gonna let me go,
then kill me now. Just get it over with.

30
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:54,233
I'd advise you
not to tempt me just now.

31
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:04,510
Why couldn't you just leave me
to do my work in peace ?

32
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:07,462
Why'd you have to go
and ruin everything ?

33
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,115
You're a killer. I catch killers.

34
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:12,757
So do I. I caught you.

35
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:15,213
I'm not a killer.

36
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:17,662
You are.

37
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,113
That's why you've always known
what I am.

38
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:23,781
That's why you have
more officer-related shootings

39
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,406
than anybody else.

40
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:28,466
Only I don't fuck with you
when you shoot somebody.

41
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,067
Why couldn't you pay me
the same professional courtesy ?

42
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,447
There's nothing professional
about what you do.

43
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,543
I kill when I have to on the job.

44
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:40,131
So it's okay to take a life
as long as you get a paycheck for it ?

45
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:42,383
The city pays me to keep the law.

46
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,070
I've got news for you, sergeant.

47
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:50,183
My code requires a higher standard
of proof than your city's laws.

48
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:55,163
At zero cost for the taxpayer ?
If you ask me, I'm a bargain.

49
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,445
That's enough bullshit, Morgan.

50
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,334
Let's get this over with.

51
00:05:00,494 --> 00:05:03,341
Either kill me or set me free. So ?

52
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,407
I think you'd like it if I killed you
just to prove your point.

53
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:09,077
- You gotta choose.
- No, I need to go home.

54
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:12,955
I've got FBI guards
standing outside my door right now...

55
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:17,356
to protect me from you.

56
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,908
What's it gonna be, Morgan ?

57
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:27,220
Kill me now or set me free !
You only have two choices !

58
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,490
You can't fucking ignore me !

59
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:34,794
What's wrong ?
The place is a ghost town this early.

60
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:36,993
Besides, I thought we were out
as a couple.

61
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,836
Out and flaunting it
are two different things.

62
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,396
- "Don't ask, don't tell" ?
- Works for the military.

63
00:05:43,652 --> 00:05:44,784
Not really.

64
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,436
My subpoena
for Doakes' phone records came through.

65
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:57,375
- He isn't much of a talker.
- Not a lot of friends, I'm guessing.

66
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,156
Except for one. Check this out.

67
00:06:01,454 --> 00:06:04,298
That's Lt Laguerta's phone
number. Look at the time and date.

68
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:07,128
He called her right after we launched
the manhunt.

69
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,209
- We could have traced that call.
- Doubt it.

70
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:12,770
Sgt Doakes wouldn't have stayed on
long enough,

71
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,285
But Laguerta
should have given us the chance.

72
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,289
You're gonna ream her, aren't you ?

73
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,565
Can I be there ?
It's a hobby of mine.

74
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,090
You can ream her yourself.

75
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:24,447
Me ?

76
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:28,443
- I can't dress down my own boss.
- It's your subpoena.

77
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,367
- Your case.
- Our case.

78
00:06:31,355 --> 00:06:33,767
And I need to know
if your Lt can be counted on.

79
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:35,572
You know her better than I do.

80
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,415
- Lox ?
- Gross.

81
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,478
That would just get me
in deeper shit with her,

82
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,606
and Laguerta already hates me.

83
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:45,626
I'm not always gonna be around
to run interference.

84
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:47,467
Come on.

85
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:50,218
You got at least five,
10 good years left in you.

86
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:54,157
I mean I won't be around
once this case ends.

87
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,334
So a reaming will be good practice
for you after I'm gone.

88
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,225
I better refrigerate this.

89
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,269
<i>Taking a life is one thing,</i>

90
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:16,006
<i>but the care and feeding of it
is another.</i>

91
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:19,476
<i>I can't keep my problem locked away
in a cabin forever.</i>

92
00:07:22,803 --> 00:07:25,800
<i>Harry always said there were
plenty of people who deserved to die,</i>

93
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:28,766
<i>but no matter
how hard I close my eyes and wish,</i>

94
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:30,676
<i>Doakes isn't one of them.</i>

95
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:36,873
<i>Harry, you never prepared me
for this one.</i>

96
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,960
<i>What do I do ?</i>

97
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:41,106
<i>What would you do ?</i>

98
00:07:43,721 --> 00:07:46,331
Get a description of Juan Ryness
to every unit in the city,

99
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:49,820
and wake up judge Morehouse. I need
a warrant for Ryness' apartment now.

100
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:53,076
- Fisk, make sure you get that print...
- She was dumped ?

101
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:56,432
Get back inside the car
like I told you.

102
00:07:58,155 --> 00:07:59,789
Blunt trauma to the head ?

103
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,460
I went over there.
No one saw.

104
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:08,166
The blow to the head killed her.
She took a brutal beating beforehand.

105
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:10,364
The guy who did this
is an evil bastard.

106
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,468
- You know who it was ?
- Yeah.

107
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,151
I've been trying to get him for a while.

108
00:08:15,348 --> 00:08:17,917
A pimp named Juan Ryness.
She was one of his girls.

109
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:21,676
- She was dumped, right ?
- Get back in the truck.

110
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,566
You awake ?

111
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,102
- You for real ?
- You got a visitor.

112
00:08:53,105 --> 00:08:54,032
Coffee ?

113
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:58,237
Yeah. Why not ?

114
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,500
I heard the news. It's everywhere.

115
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,609
Sgt Doakes
is the Bay Harbor Butcher ?

116
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,640
That's what they're saying.

117
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,702
I was right about you.
Are you okay ?

118
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,077
Why is the fbi guarding your building ?

119
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,426
You know the federal government.

120
00:09:22,586 --> 00:09:24,424
Any excuse to spend money.

121
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:28,711
It's cold.

122
00:09:29,775 --> 00:09:30,588
Sorry.

123
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:33,711
There's nothing better
on a muggy Miami morning

124
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:36,353
than an iced coffee, right ?

125
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:44,050
How are the kids ?

126
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,651
They asked about you again.

127
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:52,471
And they've been pretty confused
since we split up.

128
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,828
Yeah. me too.

129
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,138
Are you still confused ?

130
00:09:58,803 --> 00:10:01,491
I'm generally confused
most of the time...

131
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:05,269
But not about us.

132
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:07,750
Good.

133
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,811
It's not good ?

134
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:16,936
No. It's...

135
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:18,992
great,

136
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:21,065
to have this

137
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:22,639
clarity.

138
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:27,033
I'm really glad you feel that way.

139
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,463
The kids
have been through so much lately.

140
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:33,443
With Paul's death
and my mom moving out,

141
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,683
I don't want them to feel like they've
been abandoned by everyone they love.

142
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,802
Does this mean we're dating again ?

143
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:50,773
That would be kind of fast,
wouldn't it ?

144
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:54,545
I mean, you're so important to them,

145
00:10:54,756 --> 00:10:56,106
and they need you.

146
00:10:57,713 --> 00:10:59,732
But... I don't know.

147
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:04,027
I mean, maybe we could just...

148
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:05,112
Hang.

149
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:08,370
Like a sloth.

150
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:10,637
I can do that.

151
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:18,907
Well, if you're free on Saturday,
we're gonna spend the day at the beach,

152
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,119
and maybe we could all hang together.

153
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,464
A family of sloths.

154
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:30,934
Let me get you some ice.

155
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:37,665
<i>I've been selfish,
only thinking about what happens to me.</i>

156
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,820
<i>But if I were ever revealed
as the true Bay Harbor Butcher,</i>

157
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:44,572
<i>Rita and her children
would be destroyed.</i>

158
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,952
- I need you to take a look at these.
- I know what they are.

159
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:20,866
You didn't report the call from Doakes.

160
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:25,192
Your task force doesn't need my help
railroading a good cop.

161
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:30,609
Doakes was officially
a person of interest.

162
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:33,429
Not reporting it could be considered
aiding and abetting.

163
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:36,683
None of you wanted to hear what
he had to say, so I didn't tell you.

164
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:41,389
- What did he have to say ?
- That he's innocent.

165
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,234
You believe him ?

166
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:47,266
What do you think ?

167
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:52,267
- And if he calls again ?
- He won't.

168
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,904
- And you know this...
- Because I know him.

169
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,271
- I thought I knew someone, too.
- I know him !

170
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:03,050
So if Lundy wants to flag me
to captain Matthews,

171
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,033
you tell him to go for it.

172
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,188
But James knows that I believe in him,
so it was worth the risk.

173
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:10,565
To your job ?

174
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:13,686
To your career ?

175
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,270
You ever care about anyone, Morgan ?

176
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:24,488
Then you shouldn't have to ask.

177
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,701
'Cause when you care about someone,
you do what you have to do.

178
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:41,080
Four different aliases
all issued by the DOD.

179
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:43,583
during Doakes' stint
with special forces.

180
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,961
We've attached these names
to our temporary felony want, so...

181
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:49,425
if he uses one, we'll be notified.

182
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,297
<i>I remember when life was easy,</i>

183
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:54,081
<i>when the only question
I worried about was "who's next ?"</i>

184
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:57,191
<i>Now it's: "How can I dodge
my protective detail ?</i>

185
00:13:57,351 --> 00:13:59,677
<i>"What should I do with my hostage ?"</i>

186
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,865
<i>These are not easy questions.</i>

187
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:07,418
Would you bring us up to speed
on the analysis from the blood slides ?

188
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:11,934
Of the 46 slides, 18 belonged
to previously known butcher victims.

189
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:16,135
We're still running the DNA,
but we've matched an additional 12

190
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:19,149
with felons in the criminal database,
all reported missing.

191
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:23,651
We'll proceed on the assumption
that these 12 were Bay Harbor victims.

192
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,881
It's a fair assumption.

193
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:31,716
Do you have
the new victims' jackets ?

194
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:34,415
Sorry, Sir. Not my responsibility.

195
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:37,100
That'd be me.

196
00:14:39,096 --> 00:14:42,574
Each of the 12 had at least
one homicide on their records,

197
00:14:43,046 --> 00:14:45,322
and we all know
how the Butcher loves a killer.

198
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:49,823
We're checking into their last known
whereabouts and any connection

199
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:52,964
that their criminal cases
may have had with Sgt Doakes.

200
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,569
Forensics, expect
a steady stream of evidence

201
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:59,333
seized from our suspect's apartment
over the next few hours.

202
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:02,699
Look for any trace evidence
that could connect him to these victims.

203
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,212
The rest of you have your assignments.

204
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:06,660
Let's bring him in.

205
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:17,221
- Is your sister all right ?
- I wouldn't know.

206
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:20,260
But I wanted to talk to you
about my protective detail.

207
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:27,047
Angel, I hear you have
12 new Butcher victims.

208
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,265
- Potential victims.
- You got names ?

209
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:35,619
Mind if I keep this ?

210
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:40,478
We're all working together now.
Why ? You got an angle on Doakes ?

211
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:08,433
That's good.

212
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,368
That's real good.

213
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,597
This is a waste of time.
If Doakes is the butcher,

214
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:15,922
we won't find trace evidence
on his clothes.

215
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:18,523
The guy we're after
is way too careful for that.

216
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:21,974
I have to agree with you there.

217
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:25,719
You think it could be Doakes ?

218
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:30,465
It's not about what I think.
It's all about the evidence.

219
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:34,035
All those times
he called me "lab geek,"

220
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:37,087
"fairy winkle", "donkey fluffer"...

221
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:40,883
I'm just glad I took it lying down,
you know ?

222
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,229
What the fuck, Dex ?

223
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:48,150
- What which fuck ?
- You got rid of your protective detail ?

224
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:50,059
She's gonna hit you, isn't she ?

225
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,079
She's gonna hit someone
if you don't get the fuck out of here.

226
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:56,380
Hair-pulling may not be manly,
but it's very effective.

227
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,956
Doakes fucking hates you, Dex.

228
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:05,876
- No doubt about that.
- And he's a trained killer.

229
00:17:06,052 --> 00:17:07,958
If he wanted me dead,
I'd be dead by now.

230
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,730
It's supposed to be reassuring ?

231
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:12,059
He's a lot of things
but he's not an idiot.

232
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:14,983
He won't come out of the shadows
because of a grudge.

233
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:16,151
Right.

234
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,722
Cause serial killers are so practical.

235
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:21,273
Actually, they are.

236
00:17:21,905 --> 00:17:24,165
I'm safer with Lundy's troops
hunting Doakes

237
00:17:24,325 --> 00:17:27,827
- than babysitting me. Lundy agrees.
- Because he doesn't give a shit !

238
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:31,190
All he cares about
is solving this case and moving on !

239
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,606
I thought he was the guy
you could count on.

240
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:39,368
You are the only one I can count on,
jackass.

241
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:47,697
<i>Got to give Deb credit for one thing:
She knows how to express her feelings.</i>

242
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:53,330
<i>If I was convicted as the Butcher,
she'd probably explode.</i>

243
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,151
<i>It'd be a waste
of a perfectly good cop...</i>

244
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:57,599
<i>and sister.</i>

245
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:02,405
<i>This isn't just about me anymore.
It's about Deb...</i>

246
00:18:02,621 --> 00:18:04,908
<i>and Rita and the kids.</i>

247
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:07,940
<i>I have only one choice for Doakes.</i>

248
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:20,909
Shit.

249
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:27,233
All right.

250
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:40,637
Yes.

251
00:19:16,081 --> 00:19:17,999
No reason for you to suffer.

252
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,134
You come to a decision ?

253
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:31,146
Yes, but I don't think
you're gonna like it.

254
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:39,407
So this is the way it ends.

255
00:19:41,193 --> 00:19:43,418
Regardless of how we got here,

256
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:46,811
one of the two killers in this cabin
has to go away.

257
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:49,392
- I am not a killer.
- Right.

258
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:55,337
In terms of who goes, it boiled down
to a philosophical question.

259
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:59,883
Which one of us
has more inherent worth ?

260
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:02,680
I know you're fucking kidding me.

261
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:05,422
First I considered our value
to the community.

262
00:20:05,598 --> 00:20:06,867
That was a wash.

263
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,433
We're both loyal civil servants.

264
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,771
We work hard to keep the city clean.

265
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:15,713
- You cut people up into little pieces.
- Then...

266
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:18,217
I looked at our personal lives.

267
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:20,954
And... well,

268
00:20:22,196 --> 00:20:24,986
That's where the differences
became clearer.

269
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:27,411
Strange as it may seem,

270
00:20:27,653 --> 00:20:30,363
I have people who depend on me.

271
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:34,876
They would be devastated
if they found out what I do.

272
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,674
You, sergeant, you're more
of a lone wolf, easier to put down.

273
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,766
No one in the pack to miss you.

274
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:44,113
Fuck you.

275
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:47,556
Fuck you ! I have a family.
I have my mother and my sisters.

276
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,374
Who you never visit.

277
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:56,523
It puts a pit in my stomach

278
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,619
that I can only interpret as...

279
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:02,938
sadness.

280
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,836
If you had a personal life,

281
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:11,249
you wouldn't have made me your obsession
and we wouldn't be here right now.

282
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:31,447
Sergeant, why would you hide
a dead drug dealer's cellphone from me ?

283
00:21:32,482 --> 00:21:35,728
You working on an exit strategy ?
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

284
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,437
If you want to bring me down,

285
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:43,694
you're gonna have
to open this goddamn cage first.

286
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:46,091
So come on. Bring it.

287
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,660
I already did.
You just didn't know it.

288
00:21:57,226 --> 00:21:58,471
Mother fuck...

289
00:21:59,664 --> 00:22:02,589
The sedative works fast.
It's probably best just to go with it.

290
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:10,680
You think you're a fucking hero, right ?
Cleaning up the fucking streets.

291
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,350
Your old man would be proud.

292
00:22:15,855 --> 00:22:17,354
My old man was proud.

293
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:20,941
He knew ?

294
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,444
He really was a fucking whack job.

295
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,283
Name-calling at this juncture ?

296
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,533
What's the point ?

297
00:22:32,029 --> 00:22:34,037
Besides, my father was a legend
on the force.

298
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,369
That's what you think ?

299
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:40,752
They never told you.

300
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,524
Told me ? Told me what ?

301
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:49,955
What about my father ?

302
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,226
What about my father ?

303
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:06,976
A missed call.

304
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:09,632
If it's Dexter,
tell him to come over.

305
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:18,415
- I have Auri on Saturday.
- Auri ? What's an Auri ?

306
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,855
It's my little girl.

307
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,285
My ex never lets me see her
on the weekends,

308
00:23:23,477 --> 00:23:25,002
but something came up.

309
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:27,356
I have her all day on Saturday.

310
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:29,635
Delightful.

311
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:33,314
But tonight you belong to me...

312
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:34,552
Yes.

313
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,480
And my walls.

314
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:43,821
<i>Doakes said I had two choices.</i>

315
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:45,665
<i>Kill him or let him go.</i>

316
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:50,155
<i>But he neglected to look
behind door number three:</i>

317
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:53,100
<i>Hand him over to the FBI gift-wrapped.</i>

318
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,497
<i>I don't need Doakes dead.</i>

319
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:58,745
<i>I just need his fingerprints
to complete my frame job.</i>

320
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,004
Almost forgot.

321
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,539
One needs small comforts.

322
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,803
<i>Every Saturday,
beginning dive classes</i>

323
00:24:37,973 --> 00:24:40,746
<i>practice underwater skills
beside this dock.</i>

324
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:45,311
<i>Tomorrow they'll find
a morbid little surprise.</i>

325
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:52,434
<i>When the feds receive these kill tools
with their suspect's prints on them,</i>

326
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:56,663
<i>the only threat to me will be
the inane rants of a murderous madman.</i>

327
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,038
<i>So close, I can feel it.</i>

328
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:17,492
<i>This tragic tale might still end</i>

329
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:20,269
<i>in Doakes' demise,
but not by my hands.</i>

330
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,099
<i>Harry's legacy will remain intact.</i>

331
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:29,882
<i>Why in the hell did Doakes
have to bring up Harry ?</i>

332
00:25:35,506 --> 00:25:36,506
Come on.

333
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:43,894
You just cut the cake, sweetheart.
I'll see who it is.

334
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:49,504
- Tom ! This is a surprise. Come on in.
- Thanks.

335
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,588
Sweetheart, cut the lieutenant a slice.
It's her birthday.

336
00:25:54,748 --> 00:25:57,574
Happy birthday, hon.
But no cake for me, thanks.

337
00:25:59,234 --> 00:26:01,666
- Can I talk to you in private ?
- Sure.

338
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,406
Save me an end piece.

339
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,002
God damn it !

340
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:14,758
Ryness is gonna walk
because of a goddamn typo ?

341
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,637
Faulty warrant. Nothing we can do.

342
00:26:16,797 --> 00:26:18,386
- This is bullshit !
- Harry !

343
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:20,889
Don't worry.

344
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:23,666
- Ryness'll make another mistake.
- Yeah, right.

345
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:26,019
We just wait for him
to kill another girl !

346
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,519
Sorry.

347
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,631
Happy birthday, kiddo.

348
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:45,300
I'll get the vacuum cleaner.

349
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:57,617
You OK, Dad ?

350
00:27:01,011 --> 00:27:03,453
I did the right thing
in training you.

351
00:27:03,626 --> 00:27:05,163
This just proves it.

352
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:08,060
I did the right thing.

353
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:17,256
Will you wait ?

354
00:27:18,725 --> 00:27:21,616
- What's going on here ?
- Nothing, according to you.

355
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,750
So I said something ?

356
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,355
Only that this relationship
has an expiration date.

357
00:27:28,253 --> 00:27:31,101
If you wanna write it off
before it even begins, go ahead.

358
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,183
- When did I say that ?
- Yesterday,

359
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:36,159
you said, "when the case ends, we end".
I'm paraphrasing.

360
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,638
I thought you understood
when we got involved.

361
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:43,569
I track killers. That's what I do.

362
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:46,403
- They tend to move around.
- I know that.

363
00:27:46,723 --> 00:27:50,722
Then I'm not sure what you thought
would happen when the case ended.

364
00:27:53,347 --> 00:27:55,538
Honestly, I hadn't thought about it,

365
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:58,319
but it looks like you have,
so now I know.

366
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,381
Consider me informed.

367
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:09,871
One.

368
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:13,793
How come there's never a circus
when you need one ?

369
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,793
I don't know. I'm not sure
I've ever felt that particular need.

370
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:19,813
Help me out here.

371
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:24,370
- What does a 7-year-old girl like ?
- Astor likes CNN.

372
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:26,583
Yeah. That's not gonna fly.

373
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:29,392
I got Auri all day on Saturday.

374
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:31,836
I want to do something fun.

375
00:28:32,062 --> 00:28:34,928
Ideally, a lot more fun than the stuff
her mother does with her.

376
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:37,486
It's really not that hard
to entertain a kid.

377
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:39,988
Rita and I are taking hers to the beach
on Saturday.

378
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:41,949
See, that sounds perfect.

379
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,190
It'd be great if we could tag along.

380
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:49,031
Sure, I guess.

381
00:28:49,191 --> 00:28:51,145
We'll be there all afternoon.

382
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,712
- Sorry, but what's with the highlights ?
- I was

383
00:28:56,882 --> 00:28:59,255
helping Lila paint her loft last night.

384
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,633
<i>Red. The color of pasión.</i>

385
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:04,425
Yeah. About Lila.

386
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:06,576
It's probably better for everyone

387
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,909
if she doesn't come along on Saturday.

388
00:29:09,069 --> 00:29:10,836
Bro, I'm not stupid.

389
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:14,569
Lila is like my after-hours project.

390
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,087
Besides, she should stay off
the beach with skin like that.

391
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,446
Like a perfect porcelain doll.

392
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:28,534
<i>"Paid 4 my lift ticket.
Where's my snow ?</i>

393
00:29:28,694 --> 00:29:30,745
<i>"Don't make me come after you".</i>

394
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,848
<i>Sounds like Mr. Harlow is not only
a master of metaphor,</i>

395
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:36,396
<i>but also inclined toward
violent confrontation.</i>

396
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:39,214
<i>Better find out who he is
in case I have to deal with him.</i>

397
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:47,178
<i>Armed with a phone number, obtaining
the mysterious text-messenger's I.D.</i>

398
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,472
<i>wasn't too hard, but is he a threat ?</i>

399
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:55,261
<i>"Christopher Harlow,

400
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,769
<i>"Narcotics, armed robbery,</i>

401
00:29:58,504 --> 00:30:01,278
<i>"and currently a fugitive

402
00:30:01,462 --> 00:30:03,186
<i>"Approach with caution".</i>

403
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:19,333
<i>This guy could be trouble

404
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:21,968
<i>of a certain cabin in the Everglades.</i>

405
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:28,335
<i>I'm safe.</i>

406
00:30:30,004 --> 00:30:31,431
<i>Happy trails, Harlow.</i>

407
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:46,600
Fuck ! Sneak much ?

408
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:49,240
Sorry. I wanted to ask you something.

409
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:52,334
That is some big hair.

410
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:54,860
Hard to believe he's our guy.

411
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:58,832
Amazing how easy it is to hide
who you are from people.

412
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:00,548
Not that easy.

413
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,372
I was thinking about your birthday.

414
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:10,383
You got like three months. Just get me
a gift certificateat Amazon.

415
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,185
Good to know, but the birthday
I was thinking about was...

416
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:16,119
when Dad threw the beer bottle.

417
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:20,326
Jesus.

418
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:23,670
Out of the blue.
What brought that up ?

419
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,560
Harry's been on my mind lately.

420
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:30,936
I was trying to remember...

421
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,786
Matthews came over that night,
right ?

422
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:35,818
Yeah.

423
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,336
He and dad got in a fight.

424
00:31:38,785 --> 00:31:42,001
I ended up wiping beer off the walls.
Happy birthday to me.

425
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,499
A killer went free.
That would upset any cop, right ?

426
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,918
- Nothing weird about that.
- No, it wasn't weird.

427
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:53,441
It was just another example
of dad's priorities.

428
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,723
Kids versus case, case always won.

429
00:31:57,776 --> 00:32:00,136
Did he say anything else about it
to you ?

430
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:02,330
Right.

431
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:05,657
Dad sitting down with me
to have a heart-to-heart.

432
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,402
Not that I didn't want to.

433
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,991
- Maybe you should have told him that.
- Yeah.

434
00:32:14,986 --> 00:32:15,986
Maybe.

435
00:32:17,341 --> 00:32:21,057
<i>Deb had it rough. Harry had
his hands full teaching me a trade.</i>

436
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,740
<i>But was there something else
going on with him,</i>

437
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:28,543
<i>or was Doakes just trying
to shake me up ?</i>

438
00:32:28,834 --> 00:32:31,009
<i>I need to know
if there's more to the story.</i>

439
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:41,643
<i>There's a complication I don't need.</i>

440
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:47,409
- Hey, baby, what brings you back ?
- I have two more walls at home

441
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:50,166
waiting for your expertise
as a painter.

442
00:32:50,691 --> 00:32:53,365
There's nothing I'd like to do more,
but...

443
00:32:53,997 --> 00:32:55,241
But what, darling ?

444
00:32:56,352 --> 00:32:57,952
I pick up Auri, remember ?

445
00:32:58,902 --> 00:33:01,534
We'll meet Dexter and Rita
at the beach.

446
00:33:02,004 --> 00:33:04,121
I have a friend at Miami art museum,

447
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:08,087
teaches an incredible children's class.
Air-conditioned.

448
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:12,216
Bring the whole gang if you like.

449
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,447
You mind if I take a rain check ?

450
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:21,142
With your history with Dexter,
it might be a little awkward.

451
00:33:21,485 --> 00:33:23,372
He tries to work things out
with Rita.

452
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:27,353
Is he, now ?

453
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:32,339
You have a great day.

454
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,944
And watch out for those sand fleas.

455
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,906
Damn. She better be worth it.

456
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:12,610
What was that shit last night ?
Some kind of fucking scare tactic ?

457
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:15,836
You said something
before you passed out about my father.

458
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:18,394
- What was it ?
- I don't know.

459
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:21,452
What was it ?
I was kind of drugged at the time.

460
00:34:23,282 --> 00:34:24,573
Don't test me.

461
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:27,241
I could have killed you.

462
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:29,171
I didn't.

463
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,750
You didn't because you can't.

464
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,999
I've had time to think about this.

465
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:39,243
I don't fit that code
you were talking about, do I ?

466
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,256
At first, I thought the Butcher
only went after criminals

467
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:47,588
because nobody gives a damn
what happens to them, but now...

468
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:51,315
- Now I think you got a conscience.
- Of course I have a conscience.

469
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:55,194
I left you a place to shit, didn't I ?

470
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:04,976
It's a small conscience.

471
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:06,817
You're actually angry.

472
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:09,446
I've never seen you angry.
This is good.

473
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:12,466
I might live to see the outside
of this cabin after all.

474
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:15,590
What'd you say about Harry ?
The words "whack job" were involved.

475
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:21,847
Is that what you're worried about ?

476
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,961
I guess it would bother me too
if it were my old man.

477
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:29,395
OK. What the fuck ?

478
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:35,346
You know how I've been looking
into your past, right ?

479
00:35:36,026 --> 00:35:37,876
That's why you're in a cage.

480
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:41,906
I found something
I wasn't supposed to see.

481
00:35:43,192 --> 00:35:46,968
- It's about your father's death.
- Heart disease. Big mystery.

482
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,545
No, the mystery's bigger than that.

483
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,822
And someone up high
didn't want it solved.

484
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:57,154
You're lying.

485
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:01,176
It was buried deep, but it was there.

486
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:05,431
What was there ?

487
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:14,024
How about we go outside
and talk about this ?

488
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:15,775
I could use some air.

489
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,952
- Not gonna happen.
- Yeah ? Well,

490
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,410
then the mystery remains.

491
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:36,506
I'm sure special ops
taught you to rattle your captor,

492
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:38,047
but I should warn you.

493
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,136
You can't play on my feelings.

494
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:44,548
I don't have any.

495
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:46,957
Oh, really ?

496
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:49,376
Who's lying now ?

497
00:36:59,572 --> 00:37:00,583
Slow down.

498
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:02,378
That's it.

499
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:12,545
- Hello, Dexter.
- Captain.

500
00:37:12,826 --> 00:37:15,527
Please. I'm a civilian today.
Call me Tom.

501
00:37:16,156 --> 00:37:17,977
You start your round yet ?

502
00:37:20,226 --> 00:37:23,453
I'm afraid Bayshore
is a little outside my pay scale.

503
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:26,638
So what brings you here
on a Saturday morning ?

504
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:32,796
I wanna know if there's anything unusual
about my father's death.

505
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:37,326
Go on ahead. I'll catch up.

506
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:43,298
His heart gave out. You know that.

507
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,826
- I heard there was more to it.
- From whom ?

508
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:49,118
Does it matter ?

509
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:57,185
I guess it was inevitable
you'd find out one of these days.

510
00:37:57,345 --> 00:37:59,320
You know, Harry was a good friend.

511
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:01,106
He was a great cop.

512
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:02,798
But...

513
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:05,313
It's a tough job.

514
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:07,906
It can wear on even the best of us.

515
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,300
My father was always firmly in control.

516
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,765
That he was, but towards the end...

517
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:17,417
Look, Dexter.

518
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,214
The system doesn't always work.

519
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:22,985
Sometimes they get away.
You know that.

520
00:38:24,348 --> 00:38:27,872
And that just got harder and harder
for Harry to deal with.

521
00:38:28,757 --> 00:38:30,899
I think that's what did him
in in the end.

522
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:33,276
What did ?

523
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,249
What am I missing here ?

524
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,551
He killed himself, Dexter.

525
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:52,286
How ?

526
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,549
The autopsy showed an overdose
of his heart medicine.

527
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,366
That happens all the time.
People accidentally take the wrong dose.

528
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:05,736
He called me the day before he died.

529
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:08,823
He asked me to keep an eye on you
and your sister.

530
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,762
I didn't realize what that call meant
until he was gone.

531
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:16,705
So I made sure that autopsy
never saw the light of day.

532
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:20,950
I was looking out for the two of you
like I said I would.

533
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,976
I'm sorry, Dexter.

534
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,936
Why don't we go to the club
and have a drink ?

535
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:37,216
- We can talk some more.
- No.

536
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:39,456
Thank you.

537
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:47,258
<i>The legendary Harry Morgan,</i>

538
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,369
<i>force for justice,
architect of all that I am.</i>

539
00:39:51,326 --> 00:39:52,326
<i>Suicide ?</i>

540
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:54,576
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

541
00:40:00,426 --> 00:40:01,876
Special agent Lundy ?

542
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:06,696
- I have good news.
- I could use it. What do you got ?

543
00:40:07,086 --> 00:40:09,130
Proof that James Doakes

544
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:11,932
can't possibly be
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

545
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:17,149
You're looking at the file of a stakeout
James and I were on as partners

546
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:18,547
7 years ago.

547
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:21,572
Very detailed.

548
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:24,236
We were doing surveillance
when one of your victims,

549
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,008
Larry Mueller, went missing.

550
00:40:26,177 --> 00:40:30,025
James and I were holed up
in a motel room 24/7 for two weeks.

551
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,051
He didn't have time to piss,
much less abduct and murder a man.

552
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:41,369
I respect your compassion
for a friend and colleague,

553
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:44,877
but I'm afraid this proves nothing.

554
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,966
It proves that he was with me.

555
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:51,723
It's all here, specific dates and times.

556
00:40:52,134 --> 00:40:56,058
- These are my personal stakeout logs.
- And they're very thorough,

557
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:58,353
but I can't use them.

558
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,821
No. This is bullshit.

559
00:41:02,743 --> 00:41:06,273
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
You can't ignore legitimate evidence !

560
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,861
I can, and I will ignore it
because you gave me no choice, lady.

561
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:13,206
Those are your personal logs,

562
00:41:13,568 --> 00:41:17,174
and your credibility was compromised
when you failed to report a phone call

563
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:19,620
from the subject
of a goddamn FBI manhunt.

564
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:22,177
It was a breach of protocol and ethics,

565
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:25,359
and you're lucky
I don't bring you up on charges.

566
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:27,632
What really pisses me off

567
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,465
is you might be right.
But in trying to protect your friend,

568
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:35,838
you blew the best shot we had
of bringing him in from the cold.

569
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,009
Come back to me
if you find evidence I can use.

570
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:48,493
I smell...

571
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:49,887
monster meat !

572
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
I got ya !

573
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:05,811
I tagged you.

574
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,942
- So ?
- So you're a monster now.

575
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,006
- Really ?
- Yeah.

576
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:14,348
Come on, socio. I'm sucking gas here.

577
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:17,669
Sorry, angel.
My leg's a little tight today.

578
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:30,506
It's too soon, isn't it ?

579
00:42:31,326 --> 00:42:33,531
For this. For us.

580
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:39,436
Rita, that's not it at all.

581
00:42:40,826 --> 00:42:42,076
Then what is it ?

582
00:42:52,193 --> 00:42:55,145
I always thought my father died
of heart disease.

583
00:42:57,604 --> 00:43:01,136
And I just found out that's not true.
He committed suicide.

584
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:04,562
God.

585
00:43:06,486 --> 00:43:09,336
I don't know why he would do that
to himself...

586
00:43:13,026 --> 00:43:14,026
or me.

587
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:20,726
Baby...

588
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:30,407
<i>Whatever Harry did and why,</i>

589
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:33,017
<i>I can't let it distract me
from my mission.</i>

590
00:43:33,191 --> 00:43:35,223
<i>Not when freedom is so close.</i>

591
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:42,966
<i>"Found out where your cabin is.
On my way. I want my fucking snow".</i>

592
00:43:53,855 --> 00:43:56,425
<i>No one appreciates
uninvited houseguests.</i>

593
00:43:58,926 --> 00:44:01,982
<i>Unless I can make the problem
part of my solution.</i>

594
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:19,483
Are you Chad ?

595
00:44:19,986 --> 00:44:22,336
It depends on what you're looking for.

596
00:44:22,556 --> 00:44:24,288
Tim said to come to you.

597
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,736
The rohypnol.

598
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:29,626
Roofies ?

599
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:31,171
You ?

600
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,336
You're just not
my normal kind of customer.

601
00:44:36,695 --> 00:44:38,036
Do stop talking.

602
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:45,306
Good luck with that.

603
00:44:58,359 --> 00:44:59,748
Thanks for coming.

604
00:45:04,264 --> 00:45:06,052
I thought we should talk.

605
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:09,042
I should talk.

606
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:10,768
I mean...

607
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,087
I yell a lot...

608
00:45:13,556 --> 00:45:15,293
and bitch and complain,

609
00:45:16,476 --> 00:45:20,883
and I keep expecting people to guess
what I want, but I never really say it.

610
00:45:22,064 --> 00:45:23,523
I'd like to hear it.

611
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:32,938
You asked me what I thought would happen
when the case ended.

612
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,541
And the truth is

613
00:45:36,785 --> 00:45:38,331
I had no fucking idea.

614
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:41,096
And that was...

615
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:44,115
Exciting, you know ?

616
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:45,759
The not knowing.

617
00:45:46,926 --> 00:45:49,076
What might happen, what could be.

618
00:45:50,151 --> 00:45:51,350
It was all

619
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:53,104
possibility.

620
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,886
And when you just assumed
that we ended when the case ended,

621
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:02,976
you crushed that.

622
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:08,736
And I want it back.

623
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,839
Wanna know what I thought would happen
when the case ended ?

624
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:16,875
What ?

625
00:46:17,523 --> 00:46:20,677
I thought the novelty
of my AARP discount would wear off,

626
00:46:20,837 --> 00:46:22,389
and you'd get tired of me.

627
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,073
My God.

628
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,762
That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said.

629
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:49,982
On our way.

630
00:46:51,136 --> 00:46:52,148
What we got ?

631
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,012
A hit on one of Doakes' false I.Ds
at a car-rental agency.

632
00:46:55,172 --> 00:46:56,953
Make, model, and license plate.

633
00:46:57,113 --> 00:46:58,207
Let's go.

634
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:12,117
My hero.

635
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,710
This place looks like brand-new.

636
00:47:17,975 --> 00:47:19,390
It's my pleasure,

637
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:22,647
Though I feel a little loopy
from the fumes.

638
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,804
So how was your day at the beach ?

639
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,371
Auri wore me out.

640
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,841
You ever try and run in the sand ?

641
00:47:34,028 --> 00:47:36,544
I never run.
You're a better man than me.

642
00:47:36,981 --> 00:47:38,608
I'm glad you think so.

643
00:47:40,012 --> 00:47:41,899
And how are Dexter and Rita ?

644
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,612
Things are good for them.

645
00:47:47,002 --> 00:47:47,986
I mean...

646
00:47:48,926 --> 00:47:50,996
I think they're gonna work things out.

647
00:48:05,922 --> 00:48:07,412
We going somewhere ?

648
00:48:11,611 --> 00:48:12,902
Well, you know,

649
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,260
I've been trying to hold off.

650
00:48:18,705 --> 00:48:19,505
But...

651
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,954
I don't know. I don't want to anymore.

652
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,881
I think it's time.

653
00:48:27,034 --> 00:48:28,114
I need you.

654
00:48:29,414 --> 00:48:30,679
You can have me.

655
00:48:31,733 --> 00:48:33,060
The thing is...

656
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,053
I like it rough.

657
00:48:47,997 --> 00:48:50,497
- Who the fuck is that ?
- Some guy I picked up in a bar.

658
00:48:52,686 --> 00:48:55,434
He's a known murderer
and your final victim.

659
00:48:57,176 --> 00:49:01,153
- You gonna do what I think you are ?
- There's no point in hiding it now.

660
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:03,462
Your life is going to rest in the hands

661
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,755
of the criminal justice system
you put all your faith in.

662
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:11,252
- I wish you the best of luck.
- Come on.

663
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,567
We were just getting somewhere,
you and me. You ain't gotta do this.

664
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,584
Come on. We'll find a way.

665
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,801
I'm afraid this is the only way for me.

666
00:49:23,176 --> 00:49:25,568
Excuse me. I need to get my supplies.

667
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:41,928
You are a very bad girl.

668
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:49,336
I'm only just getting started, baby.

669
00:49:51,276 --> 00:49:52,522
Be right back.

670
00:50:41,716 --> 00:50:43,315
Lila, you want a beer ?

671
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:55,541
Jesus.

672
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:07,578
This is detective angel Batista
from Miami Metro homicide.

673
00:51:07,742 --> 00:51:09,286
I need an ambulance.

674
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,865
There is no way people
are gonna believe I did this shit.

675
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,658
You were US special forces.
I'm sure you have done this.

676
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:24,260
Wartime circumstances,
heat of the battle.

677
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:26,247
But never cold-blooded.

678
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:29,222
I'm sure that made things easier
for you.

679
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:32,445
Morgan, goddamn it,
you got a conscience.

680
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:35,292
You said it yourself.
You go after killers.

681
00:51:35,452 --> 00:51:39,321
You take out killers. I get that.
But this is some sick-fuck ritual.

682
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,089
You need help. Let me help you.

683
00:51:41,249 --> 00:51:43,964
Don't worry, I won't make you
watch. I'm not uncivilized.

684
00:51:44,152 --> 00:51:45,386
Morgan, no !

685
00:51:47,965 --> 00:51:50,839
You don't have to do this !
You don't have to kill this man !

686
00:51:51,003 --> 00:51:55,451
This man is a felon with a body count.
He brought it on himself.

687
00:51:55,636 --> 00:51:57,843
Morgan, turn him over to the law.

688
00:51:58,133 --> 00:51:59,988
I live by my father's law.

689
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:03,471
Morgan, don't do this !

690
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:13,105
Shit.

691
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:38,811
Sorry it had to go down like this.
But there really was no other way.

692
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:44,489
Sergeant ?

693
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:49,480
Stay away.

694
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:53,376
Just stay away from me.

695
00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:57,499
<i>I've heard those words before...</i>

696
00:52:57,691 --> 00:52:59,987
<i>Three days before my father's death.</i>

697
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,740
Hey, dad.

698
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,332
Look what I did.

699
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,173
It's Juan Ryness,
the pimp who killed that girl.

700
00:53:17,522 --> 00:53:19,118
I finally got him for you.

701
00:53:41,538 --> 00:53:43,902
Dad, what's wrong ? Are you okay ?

702
00:53:44,957 --> 00:53:48,108
Just stay away... please.

703
00:53:49,324 --> 00:53:50,324
Stay away.

704
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:55,636
<i>It was me.</i>

705
00:53:56,888 --> 00:53:59,170
<i>The idea of a code was one thing...</i>

706
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:00,803
<i>A grand idea.</i>

707
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,560
<i>A noble cause.</i>

708
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:05,228
<i>But the reality of it ?</i>

709
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:08,249
<i>Harry walked in on what he created...</i>

710
00:54:09,656 --> 00:54:11,806
<i>And he couldn't live with himself.</i>

711
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:22,637
What, Morgan ?

712
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:24,826
What now ?

713
00:54:28,175 --> 00:54:29,706
I killed my father.
