1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,024
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:05,385
<i>I'm on edge.</i>

3
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:08,328
<i>Thirty eight days have passed
since I killed my brother.</i>

4
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:11,343
<i>In that entire time,
I haven't had a single night to myself.</i>

5
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:13,584
<i>Sergeant Doakes makes sure of that.</i>

6
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:16,811
<i>With Doakes tailing me,
my life's been all Jekyll and no Hyde.</i>

7
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,865
<i>My brother would be so disappointed.</i>

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,263
Don't forget:
tell the universe what you need.

9
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:23,984
<i>I really need... to kill somebody.</i>

10
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:26,071
I've been waiting a long time for this.

11
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,394
What the fuck...

12
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:35,645
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

13
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:37,882
<i>I followed the code. The stalk was good.</i>

14
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,286
<i>I'm just a little rusty
since killing my brother.</i>

15
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,399
<i>Debra can't sleep
in an empty house anymore.</i>

16
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:45,372
<i>I guess that's what happens
when your fiancé</i>

17
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,146
<i>tries to slice you up
into small bloodless pieces.</i>

18
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,720
Welcome back, Morgan.

19
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,029
Thanks.

20
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:55,572
You just gotta look her in the eyes
to know she's not right.

21
00:00:55,988 --> 00:00:58,273
- Are you that...
- What the fuck are you doing ?

22
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,993
Rita, I'm not doing
real good in here, okay ?

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,219
Will you help me ?

24
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:03,838
I found the fucking shoe, okay ?

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,099
That's great !
I'll call the lawyer in the morning !

26
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,402
<i>I'm not gonna let you drag
Dexter into this !</i>

27
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:11,319
The prison called.

28
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:12,814
Paul's dead.

29
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:15,048
And I could have helped him.

30
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:17,006
That was his own fault.

31
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:19,287
Was it ?

32
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,260
What's the matter with you today ?

33
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:24,986
Just a little off my game.
I'll get it back.

34
00:01:27,243 --> 00:01:29,051
Felt like she was asking me something.

35
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:31,645
That's her son.
She says she knows who killed him.

36
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,045
Some guy named Little Chino.

37
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:36,328
She wants you to find Little Chino
and kill him like a dog.

38
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:39,129
Are you willing to testify

39
00:01:40,028 --> 00:01:42,564
that Little Chino picked up your son
on the night of his death ?

40
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:44,471
Come on, don't back down now.

41
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,228
I want him to pay.

42
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:49,643
<i>A challenge.</i>

43
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,502
<i>A mountain to climb.</i>

44
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:52,941
<i>I need this one.</i>

45
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,227
<i>The scene of the failed crime.</i>

46
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,972
<i>No better place to try again.</i>

47
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:03,374
<i>I don't normally experience failure.</i>

48
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,749
<i>Thirty nine days, twenty two hours,</i>

49
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:08,502
<i>and eighteen minutes
since I killed my brother.</i>

50
00:02:08,748 --> 00:02:09,950
<i>I am cursed.</i>

51
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:13,494
<i>Two treasure hunters
made a ghastly discovery today,</i>

52
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,646
<i>when they stumbled on what appears
to be an underwater graveyard,</i>

53
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:18,698
<i>in a crevasse, off the coast of Miami.</i>

54
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,627
Do you know what that means ?

55
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,643
There might be
a new mass murderer out there,

56
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,639
way worse than the Ice Truck Killer.

57
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,002
<i>I'm drifting.</i>

58
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:31,344
<i>I finally get a chance to kill
and I can't do it.</i>

59
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,746
<i>And a second chance and he gets away.</i>

60
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:46,667
<i>And now all my secrets are floating
to the surface.</i>

61
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:52,165
<i>Where is the orderly, controled,
effective, Dexter ?</i>

62
00:04:52,718 --> 00:04:54,427
<i>How did I loose him ?</i>

63
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:56,679
<i>How do I find him again ?</i>

64
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:02,145
<i>I'm drifting.</i>

65
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:06,936
<i>But not to sleep.</i>

66
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:15,301
<i>A shocking and gruesome discovery
off the coast of Florida yesterday.</i>

67
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:16,851
<i>Police are still searching through</i>

68
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:19,822
<i>mountain of evidence
found lying at the bottom of the ocean.</i>

69
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,923
<i>Sources say
there could be multiple victims...</i>

70
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:47,865
<i>Here I am.
Back in the belly of the beast.</i>

71
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,664
<i>But how can I solve a crime</i>

72
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:52,219
<i>when I can't even solve
what's wrong with me ?</i>

73
00:05:53,695 --> 00:05:55,120
<i>Yet, duty calls.</i>

74
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:02,467
Eight confirmed.

75
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,994
Eight confirmed, here ?

76
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:07,791
- Here is just one.
- We're talking 8 confirmed victims

77
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:09,314
in the Bay Harbor Butcher.

78
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:12,710
"The Bay Harbor Butcher" ?

79
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:16,495
That's what the press is calling
whoever dumped those bodies off shore.

80
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,387
Has a nice ring to it, no ?

81
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:20,076
Well, it's a little...

82
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,379
- lurid.
- Lurid and possibly wrong.

83
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:26,824
Part of me is hopping they found
the Ice Truck Killer dumping ground.

84
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:27,994
Tell me about it.

85
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:30,325
Last thing Miami needs
is another serial killer.

86
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:34,099
Eva Arenas

87
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:37,913
All she wanted was justice against
the 29th St. Kings for whacking her son.

88
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:41,357
- First she is the messenger.
- Now, she's the god damn message.

89
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,391
Death by machete.

90
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,290
Again.

91
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,083
We got a BOLO on Little Chino.

92
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:52,234
Gang crash unit,
all local patrols after that cabron.

93
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,745
<i>Last thing I want is for the cops
to bring Little Chino in.</i>

94
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,083
<i>He's mine.</i>

95
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,393
Why don't you take a picture, Morgan,
it will last longer.

96
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:03,010
What would I do without you sergeant ?

97
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:15,221
<i>Please segnora, mas despacias</i>

98
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,490
<i>- Please slower...
- It's mas despacio !</i>

99
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,416
She saying any fucking cops
aren't do nothing.

100
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,593
- Grand Ma really talk like that ?
- Not exactly.

101
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,103
But you got the point.

102
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,503
Right, bitch ?

103
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,971
Fuck the people don't wanna help.

104
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:37,719
Shit, she got a little girl.

105
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:39,512
I know.

106
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:43,632
This stuff never gets to you ?

107
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:48,052
I'm more of a crying
on the inside kind of guy.

108
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:51,540
Mister Ice Truck Killer
look like a god damn artist.

109
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:57,764
Sorry, Morgan.

110
00:07:58,307 --> 00:07:59,410
What ?

111
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:01,852
I'm so over that.

112
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,495
You're just fucking with me.

113
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,792
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

114
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:18,506
Fiancé...

115
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,196
Incarnate.
Couldn't pick a worst time, right ?

116
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,470
Hey, Esmée,

117
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:27,113
how about you take off,
let me handle this ?

118
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,690
I couldn't let you do that.

119
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:34,768
I'll write up the report
and e-mail it to you for signature.

120
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,161
Okay ?

121
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:44,881
I want Morgan to report to me
first thing in the morning

122
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,332
about that bar fight of hers.

123
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,178
I owe you.

124
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,938
Get in there.

125
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:07,077
There's somebody else, get in there now.

126
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:28,692
<i>Pobrecita.</i>

127
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:30,692
Seeing her mother that way...

128
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,054
can you imagine that ?

129
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,622
I can't even go there, Angel.

130
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:52,537
This one's on us, man.

131
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,111
<i>If I had kid Chino last night</i>

132
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,855
<i>that little girl's mother
would still be alive.</i>

133
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:19,223
<i>I gotta find Chino before he finds me.</i>

134
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,165
<i>...bringing to an even dozen
the number of bodies found off-shore.</i>

135
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:27,540
<i>I have to focus.</i>

136
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:28,978
<i>Tune everything out.</i>

137
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,587
<i>So far, authorities have no clue
as to who that criminal...</i>

138
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:34,309
<i>If I don't, being linked
to my beautiful bodies at work</i>

139
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,303
<i>will be the least of my worries.</i>

140
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,127
<i>Shit ! Little Chino.</i>

141
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:41,875
<i>He was out there.</i>

142
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:43,428
<i>Timing could be better.</i>

143
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,896
<i>That, plus I don't have my tools, but...</i>

144
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:53,270
<i>It does give me the chance
to tie up one mess of loose end.</i>

145
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:07,709
That's you, sergeant.

146
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:10,096
Who else you got following you ?

147
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:12,847
Apparently no one.

148
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,600
Go ahead. Try it.

149
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:19,807
I've been waiting.

150
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,033
In this neighborhood ?

151
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:24,237
It's full of crazies.

152
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,523
I'd lock my doors.

153
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:43,881
Bathroom's all yours.

154
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:46,824
It kind of always was.

155
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,206
We ran out of glasses ?

156
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:57,509
- Clean ones.
- Come here a sec'.

157
00:11:58,305 --> 00:12:01,156
I found a couple of places on Craig's
list that you should check out.

158
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:04,191
Two bedrooms, two baths,
limited water views...

159
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,285
- It has its own gym.
- I hate it.

160
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,102
Alright.

161
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:11,304
One bedroom, one bath,
art deco building ?

162
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:12,645
Shitty neighborhood.

163
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,081
It gets morning sun !

164
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:19,103
- Come on, Deb, give it a chance.
- Look, Dex,

165
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,696
I appreciate the brotherly love,

166
00:12:20,743 --> 00:12:22,684
but I've got the lieutenant
in like an hour.

167
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,058
See you at the job.

168
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:28,239
<i>I will not kill my sister...</i>

169
00:12:48,015 --> 00:12:49,750
- Hey you !
- Dexter ?

170
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:53,591
Astor ? Sweetie, what's the matter ?

171
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:55,860
Mum's acting all weird and stuff.

172
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:58,149
What kind of weird ?

173
00:12:58,213 --> 00:13:01,076
She keeps talking to people
on the phone about my dad,

174
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:03,045
<i>then she starts yelling at them.</i>

175
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:04,860
<i>Then, she yells at me and Cody.</i>

176
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:06,073
I'm on my way.

177
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:12,342
No. Calm is what I was 35 minutes ago.

178
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,789
Pissed is what I am now.

179
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:16,887
Hey ! Who wants Eggos ?

180
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:19,898
I got blueberry or chocolate. Or both.

181
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:21,795
- Both.
- I don't care.

182
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:25,205
Assholes !

183
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,730
They did everything but help.

184
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:29,861
Which assholes were you talking to ?

185
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:33,180
Funeral home assholes.

186
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,358
You're having a funeral for Paul ?

187
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,399
Not for Paul. For the kids.

188
00:13:39,421 --> 00:13:40,521
For me.

189
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:42,198
We had this old insurance policy.

190
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:44,729
It's about five thousands,
but it should cover everything.

191
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,943
You know, the county
will bury Paul for free.

192
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:48,396
I mean...

193
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:49,887
He wasn't even your husband.

194
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:51,501
Any more.

195
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,250
Technically.

196
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:58,038
Then, you could use the insurance money
for a starter scholarship for the kids.

197
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:03,376
Dexter, I didn't ask for your help
or your advice.

198
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,787
<i>I'll never understand how people
deal with death.</i>

199
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,923
<i>Why they can't just...
put it in its place.</i>

200
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:17,873
<i>Now, I have to find someone
who knows I'm looking for him.</i>

201
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:21,093
<i>Not exactly ideal
in the element of surprise department,</i>

202
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:25,114
<i>and I have to find a new way to dispose
of Little Chino's body.</i>

203
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:28,948
<i>If I can close the deal, this time...</i>

204
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:36,934
You totally douched me in there.

205
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,263
You clocked a guy in a bar,
who touched your arm.

206
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:45,618
Yeah, I told the lieutenant
you weren't ready for active duty.

207
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:48,024
Well, thank you for the fucking vote
of confidence.

208
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:50,961
Nice.

209
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:54,247
13 ! Confirmed.

210
00:14:54,784 --> 00:14:57,378
You know, buzz in the halls
is that the Feds are coming in

211
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,621
on the Bay Harbor bodies.

212
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:01,590
Well, that figures.
FBI does all the heavy lifting,

213
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,378
Captain Matthews takes all the credit.

214
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,845
Nice political move

215
00:15:04,866 --> 00:15:08,111
- when you're buckin' for deputy chief.
- Any idea who the FBI's sendin' ?

216
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:10,838
- Some guy named Landy.
- Frank Landy ?

217
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:12,784
He's a rock star.
The Green River killer

218
00:15:12,806 --> 00:15:15,216
and the DC sniper ?
The case was impossible, he broke it.

219
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,194
We're damage goods
around here, but you...

220
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,491
You should do whatever you can
to get on Landy's task force.

221
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:24,304
It's a career maker.

222
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:30,390
Just visualize that door of opportunity
just opening up wide for you.

223
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:32,561
And just walk right through it.

224
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:37,457
Angel, you keep up with this whoo-hoo
shit, I'll walk right through you.

225
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,697
<i>Little Chino... Shit !</i>

226
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,067
<i>This guy is officially
the highest point in all Florida.</i>

227
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,230
<i>But what's he doin' here ?</i>

228
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:56,518
People tell me you're
lookin' for my client.

229
00:16:02,049 --> 00:16:03,382
People tell you right.

230
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,472
Fuck, he's big !

231
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:14,907
The harder they fall...

232
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:18,275
That come with the story ?

233
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:20,486
Cut myself shaving.

234
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:23,436
<i>Well, you should be more careful, amigo.</i>

235
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,889
My client's been repeatedly
harassed by this department.

236
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:28,237
- Frankly we considering...
- Cut the shit, Raul.

237
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:32,353
<i>There was another murder
in East Kendle yesterday and my client...</i>

238
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,403
Word on the pavement is
you're lookin' for me regarding this...

239
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,272
- Tragedy.
- You bet your ass, we are.

240
00:16:38,784 --> 00:16:40,230
The victim was the mother

241
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:43,211
<i>of one of your compadres
who we know you killed.</i>

242
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:46,345
- But can't prove. Right, Officer ?
- It's "Detective".

243
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:50,740
<i>- And can't prove yet.
- Show 'em the disc.</i>

244
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:04,075
Time-stamp has this
at yesterday afternoon.

245
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:06,397
- Same time as...
- Eva Renez's TOD.

246
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:09,017
That's bullshit.
Anyone can reset a time-stamp.

247
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:10,147
Check it out.

248
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:11,801
Yesterday's paper.

249
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,739
That arrogant prick.

250
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,230
He knew we'd peg him
for Elena's murder so...

251
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:19,634
he covered his ass,
had someone else do the deed.

252
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,896
- That makes him an accomplice, right ?
- Not without evidence.

253
00:17:23,529 --> 00:17:25,060
Cut him loose.

254
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:38,863
<i>Red Rover, Red Rover
send Chino back over.</i>

255
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:53,587
Dex, check this out.

256
00:18:01,339 --> 00:18:03,086
Thirteen and counting.

257
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:06,960
They're so swamped up there,
they had to bring in outside talent.

258
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,065
<i>Which would be moi.</i>

259
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:15,107
Bet this guy never expected
his work to see the lighta day.

260
00:18:16,265 --> 00:18:17,822
I bet you're right.

261
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:21,607
Still it can't be easy
to hide a body nowadays.

262
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:22,729
You shittin' me ?

263
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:25,472
Hypothetical:
you're the Bay Harbor Butcher.

264
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,424
How do you make sure
disposed body stays disposed ?

265
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:31,308
Tons of options:
Everglades, alligators...

266
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:34,774
pig farms, sulfuric acid,
wood chipper, incinerator.

267
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,980
Hell ! Even meat pies.

268
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:38,393
The mind boggles.

269
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:41,192
Don't all those run the risk
of contact with the outside world ?

270
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:43,211
You got a better idea ?

271
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:51,159
<i>And that's the problem. Where do I put
Chino when I'm done with him ?</i>

272
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,148
Captain's comin' up with that FBI guy.
He's got a fuckin' entourage.

273
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,030
<i>So this is the man who stands</i>

274
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:10,017
<i>between me and death row.</i>

275
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:18,843
Listen up, everyone.

276
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:21,356
Briefing room in 2 minutes
for show and tell.

277
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:27,247
All right. The Bay Harbor Butcher case.

278
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,157
is now a Miami Metro case.

279
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:35,062
And it is shaping up to be
the biggest one in our history.

280
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,096
Now it's fourteen confirmed.

281
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:38,996
The FBI has sent over

282
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:42,003
their top man, Special Agent Frank Landy
to help solve this crime.

283
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:43,385
Now...

284
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:47,576
This will not be
a jurisdictional circle jerk.

285
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:49,972
This will be a shining exemple

286
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,784
of two agencies

287
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:54,831
working together for the public good.

288
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,827
Agent Landy...

289
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:00,155
Hello, everyone.

290
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:03,178
There is no such thing
as the perfect crime.

291
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:05,614
Not in my experience anyway.

292
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:07,039
With your help,

293
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,790
and with the mistakes
this person has made in,

294
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,768
or will eventually make,

295
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,992
we'll find whoever did
this aweful thing.

296
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,474
I need everyone in every department

297
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:18,646
up to speed on what we're doing.

298
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:22,043
While I review your files
and put our task force together.

299
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:26,470
So, let's get a jump start
on the Bay Harbor Butcher.

300
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:29,582
A moniker which by the way repulses me.

301
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:31,484
<i>Well, we have something in common.</i>

302
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:32,838
Someone get the lights ?

303
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:41,871
First report from the field
had these parts as comin'

304
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,777
<i>- from one body.
- Actually it's two.</i>

305
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:44,977
Actually it's two.

306
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,484
There has been speculation that this

307
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,583
human harvest might be connected
to a case you've recently solved.

308
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,267
But there are
several inconsistencies between

309
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,947
the two sets of body parts.

310
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:58,223
Gender, exsanguination...

311
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,679
specific methods of dissection.

312
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:02,951
<i>Not to mention my guys deserved it.</i>

313
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,056
The evidence just isn't there
to piggy bag this

314
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,990
onto the Ice Truck Killer.

315
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:10,481
We're looking for a different suspect.

316
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:12,641
All information regarding this case...

317
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:14,408
Miss me, brother ?

318
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,492
<i>I can't afford to lose it like this.</i>

319
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,481
<i>Not with Special Agent Rock Star
on my case.</i>

320
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,051
<i>I need to clear the Dex.</i>

321
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,969
<i>And my head.</i>

322
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,068
<i>I'm coming for you tonight,
Little Chino.</i>

323
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:46,376
<i>And this time
there won't be any screw ups.</i>

324
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:48,738
You just simen your CO2 cartridge here.

325
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:51,237
Put in your tranq dart and that'll rip.

326
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:52,619
Wham bam

327
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,469
lights fucking out.

328
00:21:55,385 --> 00:21:56,899
So gators givin' you trouble, Dex ?

329
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,511
They... ate my puppy.

330
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,110
This sucker...

331
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,277
You load her up right should take down

332
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,909
the goddamn grizzly.

333
00:22:07,932 --> 00:22:10,435
You may have to get closer
than you like.

334
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,956
She'll do the job, I promise you that.

335
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:15,492
So which'll be ?

336
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,228
Both.

337
00:22:19,886 --> 00:22:21,409
Excellent.

338
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:10,120
First time ?

339
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,568
Sort of.

340
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:15,143
Yeah, I been boxing since I was 10.

341
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,950
- Tough neighborhood ?
- Tough family.

342
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:22,135
And those were just my sisters.

343
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,028
Want some help ?

344
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,282
I'm doin' enough damage on my own.

345
00:23:28,328 --> 00:23:29,793
Is that a yes or a no ?

346
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:33,408
That was a yes.

347
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,509
It sounded like a no, but...

348
00:23:38,472 --> 00:23:39,995
Good answer.

349
00:23:45,705 --> 00:23:46,959
First...

350
00:23:48,954 --> 00:23:50,670
we need to wrap your wrists.

351
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:53,353
So you don't hurt yourself again.

352
00:24:04,171 --> 00:24:05,271
I'm sorry.

353
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,970
You scared the shit outta me.

354
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:34,180
How you doin' ?

355
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,339
How am I doin' ?

356
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,510
I saw the man I thought I loved.

357
00:24:40,664 --> 00:24:43,841
No, did love.
Up on some goddamn screen.

358
00:24:44,123 --> 00:24:47,159
With a gallery full of women
he murdered and cut into pieces.

359
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,121
Don't.

360
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,379
You fuckin' asked.

361
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:54,474
So how am I doin' ?

362
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,495
I'm just fine.

363
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,137
<i>I might be playing fast and loose</i>

364
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:21,807
<i>with my father's code, but I don't think
Harry would disapprove.</i>

365
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:23,734
<i>Considering...</i>

366
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:27,812
<i>Attaboy, Chino. A little closer.</i>

367
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,952
<i>Come on, don't get the shakes now.
This is no time for performance anxiety.</i>

368
00:25:57,548 --> 00:25:58,915
I've been waitin' for you.

369
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:02,235
Take him.

370
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:05,734
He's there.

371
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:18,654
I don't know.
I don't know where the fuck he is.

372
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:29,782
<i>Come out, come out wherever
you are, cabron.</i>

373
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:36,147
We'll be out here
all night long if we have to.

374
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,943
You find him, okay ?

375
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,459
<i>What the hell is wrong with me ?</i>

376
00:26:52,214 --> 00:26:53,736
<i>Someone's coming.</i>

377
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:09,441
<i>It's okay, I got you.</i>

378
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,717
<i>- Please don't hurt us !
- Oh, my God !</i>

379
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:14,867
<i>What the fuck is this ?</i>

380
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:24,675
<i>Dexter, don't leave me !</i>

381
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:28,147
<i>Biney !</i>

382
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,721
<i>- Don't leave me !
- Get in there !</i>

383
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:35,221
<i>Please, don't leave me !</i>

384
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,742
<i>- Somebody else get in there now !
- Biney !</i>

385
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:42,716
<i>Wait ! Don't leave me !</i>

386
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:47,062
Bryan... My brother.

387
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:54,998
Come on,
somebody must've seen somethin'.

388
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,920
Seing and talking
are 2 different things.

389
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,319
Want me to knock out some doors ?

390
00:27:58,418 --> 00:27:59,923
Or maybe some heads.

391
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:01,694
Sorry, I'm late.

392
00:28:01,745 --> 00:28:04,065
What fucking asshole left this here ?

393
00:28:04,328 --> 00:28:06,523
It's Special Agent Fucking Asshole.

394
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,107
- Morgan, right ?
- We got witnesses to interview.

395
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:15,990
You seen my brother ?

396
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,627
Excuse me, sir.
You have a minute ?

397
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,095
Or three.
Good tea takes time.

398
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,583
What's up, Sergeant ?

399
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:43,643
It's about your task force. I think
I can bring something to it, sir.

400
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,202
I've looked into your jacket,
sergeant.

401
00:28:47,322 --> 00:28:49,358
You've done some fine work here,
in Homicide.

402
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:51,770
- Miami Metro's lucky to have you.
- Thank you, sir...

403
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,130
But I don't think you'd be
a good fit for my team.

404
00:28:55,155 --> 00:28:56,832
I thought you just said I was qualified.

405
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,853
I said you've done
some fine work in Homicide.

406
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:01,595
Frankly, sergeant, you're more
of a leader than a team member.

407
00:29:03,322 --> 00:29:05,940
I'm not convinced
to play well with others.

408
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:18,344
Can someone clean this shit up ?

409
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,225
<i>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle
missing a piece.</i>

410
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:26,492
<i>And I'm not even sure
what the picture should be.</i>

411
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:30,759
I've been calling you for hours.

412
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,863
I kinda pulled an all nighter.

413
00:29:37,706 --> 00:29:39,222
I called the station.

414
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:42,933
I was off the clock.
It's this huge case I'm workin'.

415
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,161
It's...

416
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:47,820
It's taking me to places
I never thougt I'd go.

417
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,324
What ?

418
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:56,082
I've been thinking a lot...

419
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:59,482
about Paul's death
and how I'm gonna deal with it.

420
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,020
And ?

421
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,340
First of all, I'm not gonna
let the county burry him.

422
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:08,670
I'm using the insurance money to give
Paul a proper funeral. It's in an hour.

423
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:11,282
Paul was such a...

424
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,437
destructive force.
Why can't you just putting behind you ?

425
00:30:14,753 --> 00:30:16,534
It's about saying goodbye.

426
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:19,489
Goodbye to him
and the grip he had on my life.

427
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,652
It's called moving on.

428
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:26,651
Go clean yourself up.
The kids are expecting you.

429
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:28,832
- I'm just gonna make you late.
- Dammit, Dexter.

430
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:32,011
I need you there, too.
You have no idea what this feels like.

431
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:44,190
Just gimme 10 minutes.

432
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:47,495
Come in.

433
00:30:48,356 --> 00:30:50,755
I can't wait to get another door
slammed in my face.

434
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:54,342
If I lived in this neighborhood,
I wouldn't talk to the cops either.

435
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:55,707
Brave guy like you ?

436
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:58,961
It's about survival.
These people have families, kids...

437
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:02,373
It's not easy to be talkative
when you got the 29th St. Kings

438
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:03,613
playing whack the witness.

439
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,914
It just takes one, right ?

440
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,390
That's it !

441
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:08,093
Put that out into the universe.

442
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,950
Alright ?

443
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:15,347
Miami Metro ! Can we talk to you ?

444
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:16,745
Go to hell !

445
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:20,808
Okay, but before we do that, ma'am,
can I ask you a few questions ?

446
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:22,415
How many is "a few" ?

447
00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:24,153
Three.

448
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:25,383
But one's a two parter.

449
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:28,215
Go away before I call the police !

450
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:29,964
We are the fucking police !

451
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:34,650
I am talking to no one
with language like that !

452
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:35,801
Look at the bright side.

453
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,617
- What bright side ?
- Comically ?

454
00:31:38,254 --> 00:31:39,525
We're batting a thousand.

455
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:42,436
There's something balancing
about that kind of consistency.

456
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,629
Goddamn it !

457
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,010
Shit !

458
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,291
What were you thinking ?

459
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:21,072
That you can spray your crap
on a police car and get away with it ?

460
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:22,207
Get off of me, lady !

461
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,453
You wanna fuck me
like you fucked that Ice Truck guy ?

462
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:26,798
You little deadbeat !
We better get every piece of shit !

463
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,937
Please ! I'll tell you where the shit is !

464
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,288
The drugs and shit !

465
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,575
- Please, don't shoot me, miss !
- Morgan !

466
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:53,719
<i>If I believed in God,</i>

467
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:56,138
<i>if I believed in sin,</i>

468
00:32:57,229 --> 00:33:00,381
<i>this is the place where I'd be
sucked straight to hell.</i>

469
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:03,801
<i>If I believed in hell.</i>

470
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,973
Come on, Dexter. It's alright.

471
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,518
... hard story of who this man was.

472
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,996
Born into innocence,
as are all of God's children,

473
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:39,958
are truly the living personification
of God through the magic of family.

474
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:42,874
Giving love... it was with his children,

475
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,856
that he truly flourished.

476
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,565
It was with his children,
that he, for all his blemishes,

477
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,991
reembraced the perfect innocence.

478
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:53,535
And that was through his children,

479
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,010
that once again,

480
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,561
God's smiled on Paul Bennett.

481
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,852
And now, the family will come forward
for a few moments of silent prayer.

482
00:34:22,572 --> 00:34:24,289
I hope you find your peace, Paul.

483
00:34:38,316 --> 00:34:39,416
Bye, dad.

484
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm so sorry for your loss.

485
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,603
Thank you.

486
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,331
Father.

487
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,664
I'm not sorry.

488
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:15,279
You're still here.

489
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:17,341
I never left.

490
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,512
Yeah, you did. I killed you.

491
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:22,725
You just took my life.

492
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:29,839
So, how do I make you go away ?

493
00:35:33,068 --> 00:35:35,467
Well, you can try doing
what these people are doing.

494
00:35:38,334 --> 00:35:39,513
I'm not like them.

495
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:49,473
Now, if it helps,

496
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:51,373
then I can tell you it's not your fault,

497
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,230
what you did to me.

498
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:54,845
I never said it was.

499
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:56,002
But you feel it.

500
00:35:57,376 --> 00:35:58,476
How do you know that ?

501
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:01,329
It's human nature.

502
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:04,824
I'm not human.

503
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:08,713
You're just fucked up.

504
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:23,507
I need to let you go.

505
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,925
You think it's as simple as that ?

506
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:37,429
Nothing's simple.

507
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:42,026
Does this mean you will be my dad, now ?

508
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:07,877
29th St. Kings ?

509
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:09,307
Yeah, we got them.

510
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:12,619
SWAT did a sweep on some auto shop those
animals were using as a front.

511
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,940
Maybe we didn't get them on murder,
but we busted their asses on drugs,

512
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:17,565
weapons and money laundering.

513
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,559
Half of them are three strikers,
so they're gonna go away forever.

514
00:37:20,661 --> 00:37:22,587
Thanks to officer Morgan.

515
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:36,497
Hey, something you should know.

516
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:39,362
Deb pulled her gun on an unarmed boy

517
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:40,879
to get him to give up the gang.

518
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:42,908
Some kid named Joey Nunez.

519
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,699
Thanks, Angel. I'll talk to her.

520
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:47,049
I'll give her one thing, though.

521
00:37:47,084 --> 00:37:48,806
She's in a motherfucking good shape.

522
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:50,612
Here comes another one.

523
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,170
We got Little Chino too ?

524
00:37:54,255 --> 00:37:55,993
That cocksucker wasn't there.

525
00:37:57,929 --> 00:37:59,129
It's too bad.

526
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:03,637
What you got ?

527
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:05,041
It's none of your business.

528
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:06,802
Damn !

529
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:17,580
Excuse me, Esme.
I opened this by mistake.

530
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:19,151
It said lieutenant.

531
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:21,159
No worries.

532
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:24,064
Today, Maria, it is all about the win.

533
00:38:24,324 --> 00:38:26,206
I think we really should enjoy this.

534
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,793
Stop me if you think
I'm speaking out of turn,

535
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:31,396
or above my station, but...

536
00:38:31,772 --> 00:38:33,778
We really don't use
the department resources

537
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,008
here for personal matters.

538
00:38:35,786 --> 00:38:36,980
What are you talking about ?

539
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,797
Well, let's, for argument's sake,

540
00:38:38,832 --> 00:38:41,369
say those phone records
belong to your fiancé.

541
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:45,859
It could open a shit ugly can of worms
you might not be able to close.

542
00:38:46,848 --> 00:38:48,649
Only if someone mentions it.

543
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:53,160
This is me not mentioning it.

544
00:39:00,616 --> 00:39:03,190
I'm new at this... This.

545
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:07,647
Not trusting the man
that I thought that I loved, and...

546
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:11,556
I really appreciate your support.

547
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,722
Hey, Deb. It's me.

548
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:30,311
Again. You're probably at the gym.

549
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:32,346
Again.

550
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,928
Look, I got some unfinished business
outside the office

551
00:39:34,963 --> 00:39:37,969
I'll probably be a little late tonight.
I'll catch up with you later.

552
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,719
<i>It was simple, really.</i>

553
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:51,908
<i>All I had to do was put myself
into the mind of a killer.</i>

554
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,715
<i>Hardly a stretch.</i>

555
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:56,689
<i>It was only a matter of time
before Little Chino</i>

556
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:59,161
<i>went after Joey Nunez
for snitching them out.</i>

557
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:09,899
<i>Here's, hoping I'm back on my game.</i>

558
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:39,496
Trust me, you're not going anywhere
this time.

559
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:42,205
Who the fuck are you ?

560
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:47,935
That kind of talk is just gonna
bring you closer to your victims.

561
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:54,028
Who the hell are you ? A cop ?

562
00:42:54,437 --> 00:42:56,624
'Cause I was cleared of that bitch !

563
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,379
No, maybe you didn't do the deed,
but her blood is on your hands.

564
00:43:05,047 --> 00:43:06,900
A lot of blood is on your hands.

565
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:12,840
Why do you care about these people ?

566
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:17,826
Actually...

567
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:19,217
Fuck !

568
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:20,945
I don't.

569
00:43:22,548 --> 00:43:24,230
Why are you doing this to me ?

570
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:32,729
I'm not so much doing this to you
as I'm doing it for me.

571
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,784
What's that ?

572
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:51,971
I haven't killed no kid.

573
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:53,631
But you killed most of her.

574
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:56,788
Her mother.

575
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,257
Her brother.

576
00:44:01,754 --> 00:44:03,121
Her innocence.

577
00:44:06,392 --> 00:44:08,762
You leave pain wherever you go.

578
00:44:14,269 --> 00:44:15,487
If you kill me,

579
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,082
what do you leave behind ?

580
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:20,813
A world without you.

581
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:23,730
Look at that, steady as a surgeon.

582
00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:58,367
<i>This kill was the first
of the loose ends I needed to tie off.</i>

583
00:44:58,975 --> 00:45:02,671
<i>I found a newer, safer place to dump
my trash.</i>

584
00:45:02,895 --> 00:45:04,640
<i>Moving at over 4 miles an hour,</i>

585
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:08,152
<i>the Gulf Stream is one of the world's
most powerful deep water currents.</i>

586
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:11,459
<i>This time tomorrow, Little Chino
will be north of Palm Beach.</i>

587
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:15,215
<i>After that, it's on to Georgia,
South Carolina,</i>

588
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,094
<i>North Carolina, until, eventually...</i>

589
00:45:19,293 --> 00:45:22,261
<i>Well, let's just say that
the North Atlantic's a pretty big place.</i>

590
00:45:38,344 --> 00:45:40,235
- Hey, you.
- I need to see you.

591
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:43,175
I was just dropping somebody off,
can't it wait ?

592
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:44,716
No, it can't.

593
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,202
Alright, then.

594
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,835
A shoe ?

595
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,856
You want to see me about a shoe ?

596
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,261
It's Paul shoe.

597
00:46:22,464 --> 00:46:23,965
What do we do with it ?

598
00:46:27,073 --> 00:46:32,152
Paul kept insisting to me
that you knocked him over the head,

599
00:46:32,353 --> 00:46:35,287
dragged him to his hotel
and shot him with drugs.

600
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,480
Sounds like one of his stories, huh ?

601
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:45,760
He asked me
to look in the yard for his shoe.

602
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:48,118
Finally, I did.

603
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:53,026
- Baby...
- Let me finish, Dexter.

604
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:59,541
I didn't have a lot to hope for...

605
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:01,686
until I met you.

606
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:04,971
You gave me something,

607
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:06,807
to believe in, when...

608
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:08,952
I didn't even believe in myself.

609
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,034
Maybe I was...

610
00:47:12,365 --> 00:47:15,386
Maybe I was so desperate
that I looked to the other way.

611
00:47:16,887 --> 00:47:18,903
Paul begged me...

612
00:47:19,514 --> 00:47:21,009
to help him.

613
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,709
And what did I do ?

614
00:47:23,204 --> 00:47:24,796
I hung up on him.

615
00:47:25,195 --> 00:47:27,945
And he was so upset,
he got into a prison fight,

616
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:30,071
and he was beaten to death with a pipe.

617
00:47:30,373 --> 00:47:31,874
It's not your fault.

618
00:47:32,753 --> 00:47:34,306
A part of, it is.

619
00:47:35,632 --> 00:47:37,629
A part of me believes that...

620
00:47:37,912 --> 00:47:40,064
with all of Paul flaws,

621
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:43,438
he paid the price for my dreams.

622
00:47:54,608 --> 00:47:56,412
Did you attack him, Dexter ?

623
00:47:58,847 --> 00:48:01,347
I'd understand if you did,
he attacked me.

624
00:48:11,043 --> 00:48:13,767
I hit Paul to protect you and the kids.

625
00:48:16,883 --> 00:48:18,702
It's totally an act of impulse.

626
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:32,509
Where did you get the drugs ?

627
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:39,111
Stolen from the evidence locker.

628
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:46,808
Wait.

629
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:48,923
Wait.

630
00:48:49,521 --> 00:48:50,724
Wait, I mean...

631
00:48:51,697 --> 00:48:53,443
First you tell me that you...

632
00:48:53,938 --> 00:48:55,781
acted on impulse,

633
00:48:56,672 --> 00:49:00,968
and then you tell me that you stole
the drugs from your police station ?

634
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:03,845
What are you trying to say, that you...

635
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:06,543
planned on acting on impulse ?

636
00:49:06,846 --> 00:49:08,666
It's all kinda jumbled now...

637
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:10,563
How did you know how to cook the heroin ?

638
00:49:11,356 --> 00:49:14,263
How did you know
what dose to give a big guy like Paul ?

639
00:49:22,911 --> 00:49:24,123
Oh my God.

640
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,163
Oh my God, why didn't I see this ?

641
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:30,977
They were your drugs ?

642
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,295
Now, it makes sense.

643
00:49:33,313 --> 00:49:35,879
That's where you disappeared to
at all hours of the night

644
00:49:35,914 --> 00:49:37,656
like Clark fucking Kent.

645
00:49:40,162 --> 00:49:42,503
Look, if there is anything,
left between us,

646
00:49:42,538 --> 00:49:46,061
you'll answer me this one question
and you will tell me the truth.

647
00:49:48,788 --> 00:49:50,669
Are you an addict ?

648
00:50:04,228 --> 00:50:05,993
Yes, I have an addiction.

649
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,123
That's good. It's the first step.

650
00:50:25,787 --> 00:50:27,422
Admitting you have a problem.

651
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,596
We get you into a program.

652
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,605
We get you the help you need.

653
00:50:32,525 --> 00:50:34,329
And I will be there for you.

654
00:50:45,197 --> 00:50:47,658
<i>If the eyes were a window to the soul,</i>

655
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:50,305
<i>then grief is the door...</i>

656
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:58,710
<i>as long as it's closed, it's the barrier
between knowing and not knowing.</i>

657
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:02,390
<i>Walk away from it
and it stays closed forever.</i>

658
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:06,129
<i>But open it, and walk through it,</i>

659
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,773
<i>and pain becomes truth.</i>

660
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:18,342
<i>And now I'm faced with the struggle
for my own survival</i>

661
00:51:18,377 --> 00:51:20,303
<i>that I always knew was coming.</i>

662
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,252
<i>I've been preparing for this
my entire life.</i>

663
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:38,253
<i>When all is settled down, Chino,
you're the same size as everyone else.</i>

664
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:45,012
Hey Dex, what the fuck ?

665
00:51:46,507 --> 00:51:48,117
Hang on, I'm coming.

666
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:58,239
It's annoying, isn't it ?

667
00:51:58,251 --> 00:51:59,649
I'm not taking the bait.

668
00:52:04,236 --> 00:52:06,485
- You're up late.
- Yeah, just surfing.

669
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,475
You got to the gym ?

670
00:52:09,763 --> 00:52:11,779
Then I was sort of driving around.

671
00:52:12,574 --> 00:52:14,146
Around what ?

672
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:16,427
Around town.

673
00:52:17,955 --> 00:52:19,711
- Because ?
- Saw some buildings

674
00:52:19,746 --> 00:52:22,150
with some "for rent" signs.
I'm gonna check them out.

675
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:28,494
Then, "Chez Dexter",
can return to its original

676
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:31,509
semi-lived-in-museum quality state.

677
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,896
- Deb, you don't need to do this.
- Yes, I do.

678
00:52:35,928 --> 00:52:37,307
You don't need to do this now.

679
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:39,876
And what about the video tours
of eligible apartments ?

680
00:52:41,097 --> 00:52:42,523
Temporary insanity.

681
00:52:46,403 --> 00:52:47,606
You sure ?

682
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:52,012
No. Get out.

683
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,213
Asshole.

684
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:59,973
<i>This way I can take care of my sister
the way Harry would have wanted.</i>

685
00:53:00,662 --> 00:53:02,408
You really wreak.

686
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:06,265
You right.

687
00:53:06,778 --> 00:53:08,775
I smell like a fucking sewer.

688
00:53:13,696 --> 00:53:15,867
<i>- For every door that closes...
- Fuck.</i>

689
00:53:18,233 --> 00:53:19,516
Sorry.

690
00:53:24,793 --> 00:53:26,577
<i>... it was always right there.</i>

691
00:53:29,653 --> 00:53:32,684
<i>I had to say goodbye,
in order to reconnect</i>

692
00:53:33,063 --> 00:53:35,022
<i>with what's really important...</i>

693
00:53:36,638 --> 00:53:38,171
<i>with who I was...</i>

694
00:53:41,582 --> 00:53:43,367
<i>with who I have to be.</i>

695
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:33,154
Rest in peace...

696
00:54:43,284 --> 00:54:44,502
I am.
