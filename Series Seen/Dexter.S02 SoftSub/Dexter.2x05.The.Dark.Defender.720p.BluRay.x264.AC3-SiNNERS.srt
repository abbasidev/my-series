1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,245
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:03,385 --> 00:00:06,638
What's the big break in the Bay Harbor
Butcher case I keep hearing about ?

3
00:00:06,802 --> 00:00:10,451
Masuka found microscopic algae
inside the garbage bags with the body.

4
00:00:10,754 --> 00:00:12,904
- It's all about the rocks, baby.
- The rocks ?

5
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:14,678
The algae we found on the rocks.

6
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:17,086
The Bay Harbor Butcher used them
to weigh his bags.

7
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,349
We assume he picked them up
where he docks his boat.

8
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:20,849
October 3, 1973,

9
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:23,750
Laura Moser and three others found
chopped up with a chain saw.

10
00:00:24,034 --> 00:00:27,611
A drug dealer didn't appreciate Laura
and her friends stealing his cocaine.

11
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:30,056
Why didn't Harry want me
to see the report ?

12
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:32,720
You were left there for days, starving,

13
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:35,309
in blood two inches thick.

14
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,348
- This is my mother.
- Gail.

15
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:41,677
He's hiding something,
I'm sure of it.

16
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:45,359
Did you kill your wife ?

17
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:47,366
- Yeah.
- Don't make me do it !

18
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:55,117
Debra, actually.

19
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:56,771
I'm Gabriel.

20
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,399
You're into the kinky stuff.

21
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,173
No, the last guy I had sex with
tried to kill me.

22
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:05,911
- There's my sponsor.
- Really ? Where ?

23
00:01:11,925 --> 00:01:14,049
Dexter, meet Dexter.

24
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:16,901
I'm gonna help the two of you
get to know each other.

25
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:20,718
You're going to tell me all
your deepest, darkest secrets.

26
00:01:21,063 --> 00:01:24,580
- But the person who did this...
- Is a person just like me,

27
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:26,437
Like you.

28
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:30,483
We're all good, Dexter,
and we're all evil.

29
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:34,272
<i>This woman sees me.
She doesn't know it,</i>

30
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:37,424
<i>but she's looking behind the mask,
and she's not turning away.</i>

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,956
Here's your cappuccino
and scone, ma'am.

32
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,165
Can I help the next person, please ?

33
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:40,159
<i>Most people hate long lines.</i>

34
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:42,343
Can I have a coffee and a danish ?

35
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:43,564
<i>The bank,</i>

36
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,438
<i>grocery store,</i>

37
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:47,075
<i>coffee bar.</i>

38
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,224
<i>Not me.</i>

39
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:54,383
Buddy,

40
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:55,841
you mind ?

41
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:01,483
<i>Want a real glimpse of human nature ?</i>

42
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:04,451
<i>Stand in the way
of someone's mocha latte.</i>

43
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:09,022
<i>It also reminds me that the good people
of Miami and I aren't so different.</i>

44
00:04:09,057 --> 00:04:11,205
<i>They have no more idea
of what I am than I do.</i>

45
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,354
All I'm saying is
these guys had it coming.

46
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,136
So what, just chop them all up ?

47
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,015
In my opinion, whoever's doing
this deserves a goddamn medal.

48
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:21,847
- That'll be $4.20, ma'am.
- Sorry, my wallet's in here somewhere.

49
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,064
I got it.

50
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,658
- Are you sure ?
- Yeah, I insist.

51
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,871
Thank you so much. You're a godsend.

52
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:45,131
Sweet mary, mother of fuck,
that's good !

53
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:47,675
You might have broken
a commandment somewhere in there.

54
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:51,959
Burning the late-night oil
with the task force ?

55
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:53,134
Hardly.

56
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,843
Till we get the report back on the
algae, it's just one big reach-around.

57
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:02,279
<i>The rocks I used to submerge my victims
may eventually sink me, too,</i>

58
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:06,204
<i>but if I'm learning anything
in recovery, it's "one day at a time".</i>

59
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:08,671
Bay Harbor Butcher...

60
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:12,552
Give me one shot.
I'd put a bullet in the fucker's head.

61
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:16,343
- You really feel that way ?
- He's killing people, Dex.

62
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,852
Dad taught us
the value of human life.

63
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:23,275
<i>Yeah, but I think we had
different homework assignments.</i>

64
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:29,561
Dispatch.

65
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,564
See you tonight ?

66
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,723
I think I'm staying at Gabriel's.

67
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,192
- I thought you were taking it slow.
- We are.

68
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,543
- No sex, just cuddling.
- My little sister, the cuddler.

69
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:45,257
I got a scalding-hot beverage here.

70
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:47,621
- Don't make me use it.
- Love you, too.

71
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:02,292
<i>I never really got
the whole superhero thing.</i>

72
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:05,719
<i>But lately, it does seem
we have a lot in common:</i>

73
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:07,265
<i>tragic beginnings...</i>

74
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:09,528
<i>secret identities...</i>

75
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,962
<i>Part human, part mutant...</i>

76
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,156
<i>Archenemies.</i>

77
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:17,208
Great way to start the day, huh ?

78
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,469
<i>Shouldn't you be moving back
into your office, boss ?</i>

79
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:21,671
I'd rather be here.

80
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:25,515
- What can you tell me ?
- Blunt force trauma.

81
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,590
The blood spatter here on the counter

82
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,442
suggests that this is where
the initial blow occurred.

83
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:34,386
Impact spatter is consistent
with repeated blows to the skull.

84
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:37,454
The victim tried to flee
to the back door

85
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,032
but didn't get far. Who is he ?

86
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:41,577
Denny Foster.

87
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,043
Worked here.
Owner said he closed up nights.

88
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:45,088
Robbery ?

89
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:47,794
There's no money missing
from the register.

90
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,411
Something this brutal is personal.

91
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:53,832
Want to meet your prime suspect ?

92
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:57,813
He has fins.

93
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,148
Should we call
the super friends for help ?

94
00:07:01,183 --> 00:07:02,838
No, I got it covered.

95
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:06,419
I found traces of blood
here on the base.

96
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:09,770
I'll bring it back to my lab,
confirm it's the murder weapon.

97
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,899
Got a next of kin we can notify ?

98
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,877
- Denny was, like, a loner...
- Who's that ?

99
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,402
The Dark Defender.

100
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,575
Denny had this great idea to put a spin

101
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,187
on that vigilante serial killer
we got running around.

102
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:44,616
Definitely has a nicer ring to it
than the Bay Harbor Butcher.

103
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,846
I'm conducting an interview here.

104
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:50,819
Denny was trying to set up
the Dark Defender as a graphic novel.

105
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:55,188
"Stalker of the night, his blade of vengeance
turns wrong into right".

106
00:07:58,485 --> 00:07:59,935
I need some air.

107
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:03,930
Thanks a lot.

108
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,635
<i>"The Dark Defender".</i>

109
00:08:19,962 --> 00:08:22,712
<i>No, Miami's too hot
for all that leather.</i>

110
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,241
The first time I got high, I was 15.

111
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,663
No, that's not right. I was 14.

112
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:32,203
No, wait.

113
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:36,796
I was definitely 15 because
it was my freshman year.

114
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,563
I remember now because I was...

115
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:41,469
dating Susie Mitchell.

116
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:46,278
We broke up 'cause I called her
by her sister Sharon's name once.

117
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:48,574
She hated when people did that.

118
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:53,086
What she didn't know was
that I had a thing for Sharon.

119
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:56,122
Sharon didn't want anything
to do with me, so...

120
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,033
<i>Don't you hurt my baby !</i>

121
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,246
<i>Don't you dare !</i>

122
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:04,800
<i>Don't look.</i>

123
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:07,304
Close your eyes. Mommy loves you.

124
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:16,761
Don't you hurt my baby !

125
00:09:49,976 --> 00:09:51,533
It's okay, mom.

126
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,213
You're safe.

127
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:04,615
That's hot.

128
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,329
Where did you drift off to, anyway ?

129
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,891
I was having this bizarre dream...

130
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:14,986
about my mother.

131
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,116
Say no more.

132
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:20,430
Oedipus complex, explains a lot.

133
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:28,222
So, what were you doing
to your mother in this dream ?

134
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:30,530
Saving her life.

135
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,860
She was murdered...

136
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,738
When I was a boy.

137
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,480
I was there. I saw it happen.

138
00:10:43,387 --> 00:10:45,837
I've never told anyone that before.

139
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,219
Come on.

140
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,841
Have you thought maybe you weren't

141
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,818
saving your mother in this dream ?

142
00:11:00,856 --> 00:11:03,264
Maybe you were saving yourself.

143
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,627
That's not what happened.

144
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,630
Don't be so sure.

145
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:10,711
When I got clean, all the seriously
fucked-up reasons I used

146
00:11:10,746 --> 00:11:12,975
in the first place began to surface.

147
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,178
This could be where
your addiction started.

148
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,995
I hope whoever did it
got the bloody chair.

149
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,329
There were 3 men.

150
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,655
I don't know what happened to them.

151
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:38,439
If these guys are behind bars,
you need to confront them.

152
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:41,027
If they're dead, hell,
go piss on their graves,

153
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:44,331
but you need to do whatever it takes
so you can get closure.

154
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:48,232
How else do you expect to get better ?

155
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:51,604
I never expected to get better.

156
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:18,007
My meth lab's in the sock drawer.

157
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,146
- This looks bad, doesn't it ?
- Yeah.

158
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:25,033
The cute panties help.

159
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:27,477
I'm trying to get to know you better...

160
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:29,961
By rifling through my stuff ?

161
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:34,800
I'm retarded.

162
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,221
And you've been so great.

163
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:51,481
You know how I told you the last guy
I had sex with tried to kill me ?

164
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:56,185
Well, that was kind of true.

165
00:12:58,273 --> 00:13:00,459
He was the Ice-truck Killer.

166
00:13:02,427 --> 00:13:03,665
Who is he ?

167
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,569
Not fucking funny.

168
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,155
Come on, Deb.
I never heard of him before.

169
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,544
- Stop it. Don't screw with me.
- I've been in El Salvador

170
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,734
visiting family for six months.

171
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,399
I just got back.

172
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:26,614
You sound like every other
jackass out there who thinks...

173
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:28,964
I'm a trophy fuck.

174
00:13:30,757 --> 00:13:33,619
You had no idea who I was
when you hit on me at the gym ?

175
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,900
When I hit on you at the gym,

176
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:39,762
it was because I thought you were hot.

177
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,156
Good answer.

178
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,041
So, what's hot about me ?

179
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:13,632
It's in the corner ! Don't hurt it !

180
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,922
Dexter, be careful.

181
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:16,957
Use a broom. It might have rabies.

182
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,574
Oh, it's right there ! Get it !

183
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,714
Watch it !

184
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,214
Careful.

185
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:26,270
Alright !

186
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:27,483
He got it !

187
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,920
My hero.

188
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:37,478
Alright, kids. Show's over.
Come on. Let's get dressed for school.

189
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:49,036
So, any armadillos in Michigan ?

190
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,436
We didn't have any in Florida.

191
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:56,497
Now it's like an invasion.
"Armadillos attack !"

192
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,458
You think you're charming, don't you ?

193
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:04,849
I'm sure it probably works for you
most of the time. It did for paul.

194
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:08,607
I know what you are.

195
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:11,212
Confused ?

196
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,500
I found these in a drawer.

197
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:16,513
Tell me,

198
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:19,690
why would Rita print out
narcotics anonymous literature

199
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,080
if Paul's dead ?

200
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:26,318
Because recently
I entered the program.

201
00:15:26,863 --> 00:15:28,063
I knew it.

202
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:32,339
- I would never hurt Rita like Paul did.
- I'm not gonna give you that chance.

203
00:15:32,394 --> 00:15:36,062
It's just a matter of time before
you pull her under just like he did.

204
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:38,792
Have you discussed any of this
with Rita ?

205
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:41,795
No, but I will if you don't
do the right thing here.

206
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:45,937
If you truly care about this
family like you say you do,

207
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:49,477
you will let my daughter
and those sweet children go.

208
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:56,458
The algae on the rocks was
exposed to both zinc and lead.

209
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:58,849
There're only 3 marinas
near Bay Harbor

210
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:00,662
which have restricted water flow

211
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:04,633
that would account for such high levels
of these specific pollutants.

212
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:08,555
Turkey creek, sunset keys,
and coral cove.

213
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:10,942
Anyone familiar with these marinas ?

214
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:13,958
Coral Cove is where my dad
kept our family boat.

215
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:17,330
My brother uses the slip now. I'll bet
half the force has boats out there.

216
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:21,358
It's one of the few marinas left
that's affordable on a cop's salary.

217
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,879
Morgan and I will take that one.

218
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:26,013
Sodoquist and Lee,
Turkey Creek is yours.

219
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,628
And, Hill and Ramos,
you've got Sunset Keys.

220
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:30,970
The rest of you, stay here
with detective Batista.

221
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:34,067
When the team reports in,
relay the information back to me.

222
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:37,109
If our killer's boat is out
there, let's find it.

223
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,499
Sorry it took so long. Couldn't find
any other crime scene files.

224
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:48,940
Probably lost in storage somewhere.
That's what I was able to dig up.

225
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:50,311
Just one file ?

226
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:52,699
There were 3 men arrested
for those murders.

227
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:55,245
One's deceased,
one's doing life without possibility,

228
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,784
and that's the only one
that's still an open case.

229
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:59,246
Santos Jiminez.

230
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:01,469
Why's it an open case ?

231
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,448
Jiminez turned state's evidence,
went into witness protection.

232
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:07,126
There's a business address
in there for him.

233
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,475
I guess after 34 years,

234
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,302
he figures all the people
who want him dead are long gone.

235
00:17:11,337 --> 00:17:12,593
<i>He figured wrong.</i>

236
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:16,145
If you can't find what you need, there's
audio tapes referenced with this file.

237
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,708
- Tapes ?
- Yes. See that notation ?

238
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,464
There was a criminal informant
working a cocaine bust from the inside.

239
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,280
- I'll take those too.
- OK.

240
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:29,877
<i>Harry always said,
"never make things personal,</i>

241
00:17:29,912 --> 00:17:31,572
<i>"it clouds your judgement".</i>

242
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:34,318
<i>But I've been living in a fog
way too long.</i>

243
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,029
<i>Today is Friday,
September 28, 1973.</i>

244
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,829
<i>This is detective Harry Morgan.</i>

245
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:42,088
<i>- Dad.
- Case file...</i>

246
00:17:42,123 --> 00:17:44,380
<i>I can't fucking do this anymore !</i>

247
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,840
<i>I have to know when the next
shipment's coming in, Laura.</i>

248
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,261
<i>Laura Moser...</i>

249
00:17:49,843 --> 00:17:51,091
<i>my mother.</i>

250
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:53,246
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

251
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,837
Harry, I'm so scared.

252
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:58,121
Everything's going to be OK.
You just need to calm down.

253
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,228
I took the cocaine as evidence,
just like you asked, isn't it enough ?

254
00:18:02,263 --> 00:18:05,009
If we want Estrada and his men
behind bars,

255
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:08,071
we have to catch them in the act
at the shipyard.

256
00:18:08,106 --> 00:18:11,098
He's gonna find out,
and then he's gonna kill me.

257
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,221
Harry, listen to me.

258
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:17,098
I think someone may have
followed us to the park.

259
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:20,541
If we were followed,
I would have noticed.

260
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,563
I just need you to hold out
a little longer.

261
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:27,332
This will all be over soon.

262
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:34,097
- I need to pick up Brian at school.
- I won't let anything happen to you...

263
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:35,387
or your boys.

264
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:41,386
You have my word.

265
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,668
<i>Harry broke his word.</i>

266
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,041
<i>He wasn't called to that crime scene
by chance.</i>

267
00:18:49,076 --> 00:18:50,431
<i>It was his case.</i>

268
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:53,203
<i>Laura Moser was his informant.</i>

269
00:18:53,238 --> 00:18:55,030
Harry knew my mother.

270
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:00,835
Our suspect is 6'2", 380 pounds,

271
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:04,094
Hispanic, drives a 1971 Ford pickup.

272
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,521
Circulate his DMV photo.

273
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,801
- I've got good news.
- Me too.

274
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:16,630
Turns out our vic, Foster,
he had a blog.

275
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:20,579
He was in some online geek flame war
with a guy calling himself "corndude".

276
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,578
The D.A. finally signed off
on your review.

277
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,253
There won't be any charges.

278
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:28,003
This corndude's real name
is Benjamin Alvaro.

279
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:34,834
Anyone in the shoot team
talk to you about counseling ?

280
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,278
Why the fuck would I need counseling ?

281
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,514
'cause you shot a man
last week, James.

282
00:19:39,793 --> 00:19:42,184
That's two shootings
in less than 6 months.

283
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:45,268
- Come on, it's got to take its toll.
- I'm fine,

284
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,772
but thanks anyway.

285
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:49,261
The sushi place next door
has a security camera

286
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:51,111
that covers the parking lot.

287
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:54,943
You know, department's
Chaplain's got a good ear.

288
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:58,507
Can we stay on the goddamn point ?
The camera caught the license plate

289
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,277
of a green-and-white pickup.
It belongs to Alvaro.

290
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:04,174
Timecode puts him here
after the shop closed.

291
00:20:04,521 --> 00:20:07,329
So send some units to stake out
Alvaro's house,

292
00:20:07,364 --> 00:20:09,271
and you and I'll take
where he works.

293
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:11,179
It's OK.
I've got Simms and Giles on it.

294
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:12,918
- I got backup.
- Come on !

295
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:14,623
It'll be like old times.

296
00:20:18,636 --> 00:20:21,158
Nina, I just got a call
from my attorney.

297
00:20:21,193 --> 00:20:23,746
We need to talk about
this visitation bullshit.

298
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:26,336
Can you just try Dexter's
office again ?

299
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,340
Miss, he's not picking up.

300
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,246
Call me when you get this.

301
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,817
Excuse me.
Are you a friend of Dexter's ?

302
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:34,029
I'm...

303
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:37,177
his decorator. Love the hat.

304
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,619
Terrence, give her a visitor's badge.
I'll take her up.

305
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,061
Angel Batista.
I'm Dexter's best friend.

306
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:48,956
Nice to meet you... Angel Batista.

307
00:20:56,963 --> 00:21:00,554
<i>My work requires me to be an expert
in analyzing patterns.</i>

308
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:05,369
<i>Now a pattern keeps emerging
from my past that's all too familiar.</i>

309
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:08,462
<i>Harry lying to me.</i>

310
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,645
<i>No wonder he destroyed the file
on my mother's death.</i>

311
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,793
<i>It wasn't to protect me.
It was to bury his own guilt.</i>

312
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,214
Look who I found.

313
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:26,894
Listen, when you're done with him,
maybe you can come over to my place.

314
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:29,716
It's a mess. Needs a woman's touch.
Yeah ?

315
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:38,351
What did you say to Angel ?

316
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,940
Dexter, these are amazing !

317
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:43,469
Lila, you can't be in here.

318
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,186
Did you find out what happened
to the men responsible

319
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:48,685
for your mother's murder ?

320
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:53,218
Dead or in prison, except for one.

321
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:57,154
He cut a deal.
Now he lives in Naples, Florida.

322
00:21:57,189 --> 00:21:58,644
He runs a tavern.

323
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,283
And what are you gonna do about it ?

324
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,246
Not sure yet.

325
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:14,461
And you're not the least bit pissed off
that this man got away with murder ?

326
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:19,706
You sure ?

327
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,641
Maybe a little.

328
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:24,808
Then go and tell him.

329
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:28,682
Healing is all about
focusing your rage

330
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:30,727
on the person that's hurt you.

331
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,606
Naples is, what...

332
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:36,399
Two hours away ?
We could go tonight.

333
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,301
- Pick me up after work ?
- Alright.

334
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,389
Can I have one of these ?

335
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,713
Sure.

336
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:56,874
What is this stuff ?

337
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:00,439
It's corn syrup and dye.
It's my own recipe.

338
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,369
Not bad.

339
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:10,220
Thank you.

340
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:21,366
Who doesn't fix
something like that ?

341
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,902
- You alright ?
- Yeah.

342
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:26,415
So, I'm thinking we're assuming
our killer owns a boat,

343
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,905
but what if he...

344
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:36,459
How do you stand this Miami heat ?

345
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:39,623
Makes my toes swell up.

346
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,819
So...

347
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:45,067
Anyway, I was thinking,
what if the killer's renting a boat ?

348
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:46,940
I can cross-reference some names...

349
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:49,682
You like cucumber sandwiches,
officer Morgan ?

350
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,438
I don't know. Anyway,

351
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:55,673
we have some of the dates
of when the victims went missing.

352
00:23:56,851 --> 00:23:59,159
It's all about the cream cheese.

353
00:23:59,352 --> 00:24:02,842
So we could cross-reference
those dates against the rental logs,

354
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:05,332
and maybe the same names will pop up.

355
00:24:08,037 --> 00:24:10,430
Did you hear anything I just said ?

356
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,434
Not one word.

357
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:16,199
It's 1:00.

358
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,110
I always stop and eat lunch at 1:00.

359
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:21,641
You'll learn that about me.

360
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,859
Why don't you sit down ?

361
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,636
You're welcome to consider it
an order if that helps.

362
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,894
The shoes, too.

363
00:24:40,477 --> 00:24:42,088
Shouldn't we be...

364
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:46,198
I don't know,
investigating the area ?

365
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,879
You're very fidgety.

366
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:51,184
Anyone ever tell you that ?

367
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,346
Yes. My father.

368
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:57,586
- You applying for the job ?
- Just an observation.

369
00:24:58,554 --> 00:25:02,196
Sorry. I'm confused. Are you
criticizing me for wanting to do my job ?

370
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:03,336
Yes.

371
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:05,399
It's 1:00.

372
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:13,795
Look, the last time I was around boats,
a killer was kidnapping me,

373
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,213
which might explain why
I'm living with my brother

374
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,554
and snooping on my new boyfriend.

375
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,916
So forgive me for being
a little fidgety,

376
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:23,874
but if it's lunch we're talking,
I'm gonna eat a fat pork sandwich,

377
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:26,529
and I'm sure as shit
not gonna eat it here.

378
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:29,047
What ?

379
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:31,761
This isn't a commercial marina.

380
00:25:31,918 --> 00:25:34,691
I haven't seen a single rental ID
on any of these hulls.

381
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:38,281
But I can see the upkeep
on this place is dismal.

382
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:40,951
Unsecure perimeter, poor lighting.

383
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,492
Come out here at night, no one'd know
what the hell you're doing.

384
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:47,675
That's why I'm going to order
24h surveillance

385
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,876
on this marina and the two others.

386
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:54,156
As soon as I finish my lunch.

387
00:26:27,643 --> 00:26:31,054
<i>I finished my spatter report,
put in for a personal day,</i>

388
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:32,901
<i>left word with Rita.</i>

389
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,162
<i>Naples, here I come.</i>

390
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:39,667
<i>I can't really focus my rage
on the man who killed my mother,</i>

391
00:26:39,702 --> 00:26:41,957
<i>not with Lila along for the ride.</i>

392
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:44,888
<i>But I can prepare for the day
when I do.</i>

393
00:26:44,923 --> 00:26:46,978
Where are you off to so early ?

394
00:26:47,414 --> 00:26:49,654
Getting out of town for the night.

395
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:52,032
- Don't wait for me.
- In the middle of the week ?

396
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:55,425
Thought I'd take the minivan out
on the open road.

397
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:57,182
Who are you ?

398
00:26:57,273 --> 00:26:58,983
You'll have the place to yourself

399
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:02,718
- if you want to tie up Gabriel again.
- Yeah, that one never fucking gets old.

400
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:06,005
Call me when you're back.
I wanna talk to you about coral cove.

401
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,315
What about coral cove ?

402
00:27:08,157 --> 00:27:10,090
The algae on the rocks sent us there.

403
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,975
If I were you, I'd really
consider moving your boat.

404
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,345
Security out there sucks ass.

405
00:27:15,615 --> 00:27:18,098
<i>That's kind of the point.</i>

406
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:21,940
<i>This little green algae
may as well be kryptonite.</i>

407
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,980
<i>If it's ever traced back to me,
I'll be helpless.</i>

408
00:27:28,726 --> 00:27:30,492
Is this a rental ?

409
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:33,238
Nope, she's all mine.

410
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:39,619
So your minivan's a she, is she ?

411
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,975
Your girlfriend must be jealous.

412
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,125
Is she cool with you doing this ?

413
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:47,312
I didn't tell her.

414
00:27:48,822 --> 00:27:51,355
Rita's mom found out I'm in recovery.

415
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,092
She wants me to leave Rita

416
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:55,354
and the kids.

417
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:04,269
She could be right.

418
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,188
I can't abandon them.

419
00:28:07,223 --> 00:28:11,526
So, what about what you're gonna say
to this guy when you get there ?

420
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:15,906
I'm sure I'll think of something.

421
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:22,037
Why don't you practice on me ?

422
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,708
I'd... rather not.

423
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:29,836
Just try.

424
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:33,424
Out loud.

425
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,087
I feel like...

426
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:49,036
you stole my life.

427
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:53,860
And ?

428
00:28:55,221 --> 00:28:58,109
I'm not the person I'm supposed to be.

429
00:29:05,388 --> 00:29:07,250
It's like I'm hollow.

430
00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:10,878
That's good.

431
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:13,612
Go on.

432
00:29:16,093 --> 00:29:18,606
I hide in plain sight...

433
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,515
unable to reach out

434
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:25,378
to people...

435
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,712
Close to me.

436
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:29,580
I'm afraid...

437
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:34,730
I'll hurt them.

438
00:29:38,596 --> 00:29:41,185
Like I've hurt so many others.

439
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:53,055
This is what he made me become.

440
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:01,469
Then that's what you should tell him.

441
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:12,913
What do you remember most
about your mother ?

442
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:20,469
<i>She had long hair.</i>

443
00:30:21,377 --> 00:30:22,609
<i>Soft...</i>

444
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,080
<i>like her hands.</i>

445
00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:37,017
That's all.

446
00:30:43,204 --> 00:30:46,968
Yup... Just like old times.

447
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:51,311
You live for this and you know it.

448
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:55,249
We could always get in the car

449
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,556
and pass the time like we used to.

450
00:31:00,877 --> 00:31:03,119
I'm not going down that road again.

451
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,744
<i>Code 1, suspect's vehicle
spotted -- one on board.</i>

452
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:10,242
- Headed your way.
- Copy that.

453
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:11,915
- I'll take lead.
- I got it.

454
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:15,449
We don't want this guy to do
anything stupid in a crowd of people.

455
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:17,796
That's what you out
here for, to babysit me ?

456
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:19,881
I'm here because I worry about you.

457
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:22,801
How many fucking ways do I have
to tell you that I'm fine ?

458
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:24,309
That's what worries me.

459
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:27,138
You're fine with killing two men ?
You're fine ?

460
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:30,454
- Been more than two.
- This isn't the army, james

461
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,794
This is my department.

462
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:34,563
I need to know you are fit for duty.
That's my job !

463
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:36,735
That's all you care about is your job,

464
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,150
even if it meant doing
pascal's man to get it back.

465
00:31:45,443 --> 00:31:47,200
How did you know about Bertrand ?

466
00:31:48,144 --> 00:31:50,287
I didn't for sure until just now.

467
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,040
I know you, Maria.

468
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:57,039
We rode together for 2 years.
When you want something, you get it.

469
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:58,572
Pascal was in your way.

470
00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:00,157
We're not talking about this.

471
00:32:00,192 --> 00:32:03,741
You all up in everybody else's shit
as long as it ain't yours.

472
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:10,765
There's Alvaro.

473
00:32:15,356 --> 00:32:18,426
- Wait til he gets out of the car.
- How long you be wiping my ass ?

474
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:20,942
Until I see my old partner again.

475
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:24,988
<i>On my go.</i>

476
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,901
- On the ground !
- Hands where I can see, Alvaro !

477
00:32:32,932 --> 00:32:34,952
Remember, this is about you.

478
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:37,626
- Not about him.
- It's alright if we get there

479
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:40,360
- and you can't go through with this.
- I know.

480
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:42,214
'Cause we can come back another time.

481
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:48,345
I want to meet him tonight.

482
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:57,771
This isn't art. This is cottage porn.

483
00:33:01,268 --> 00:33:02,817
That's Rita.

484
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:07,960
Say no more.
I need to take a shower anyway.

485
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:10,948
<i>Don't leave without saying goodbye.</i>

486
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:18,107
<i>It's so good to hear your voice.
I was starting to get worried.</i>

487
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,262
<i>- You still on the road ?
- No, I just got in.</i>

488
00:33:22,865 --> 00:33:25,036
Well, you said you'd call.

489
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,005
Where are you ?

490
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,050
I decided to look up someone
from my past.

491
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:33,888
That's what suddenly came up ?

492
00:33:37,163 --> 00:33:39,248
<i>Dexter, what's going on ?</i>

493
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:42,995
Well, after this morning, I figured
it'd be better if I kept my distance.

494
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:46,653
<i>- What happened this morning ?
- Let's just say</i>

495
00:33:46,714 --> 00:33:49,239
your mom isn't
a big fan of men in recovery.

496
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,741
Oh, shit.

497
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:53,910
<i>Look, this means nothing.</i>

498
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:56,962
<i>I'm gonna take care of this.</i>

499
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:58,735
<i>Now, when are you coming back ?</i>

500
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:02,586
- Tomorrow morning.
- Promise me you'll stop by the house 1st thing.

501
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:05,513
Sure.

502
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,513
<i>I'm so sorry about this, Dexter.</i>

503
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,552
See you soon.

504
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:40,132
Why are you not in the shower ?

505
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:42,924
I know. I'm just checking
some e-mails.

506
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:45,592
We have to be at the restaurant
in half an hour.

507
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:51,175
Sure you don't want to join me ?

508
00:34:51,435 --> 00:34:53,034
You stink.

509
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:55,981
Thought you liked it dirty.

510
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:23,596
"Ice princess" ?

511
00:35:24,837 --> 00:35:26,037
Fuck.

512
00:35:41,423 --> 00:35:43,995
- You son of a bitch !
- Deb, what did I do ?

513
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,235
You lied to me ! You're a writer !

514
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,649
I'm trying to be, yeah !

515
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:50,620
I saw all of those e-mails
you sent to those publisher.

516
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:52,928
- The ice princess !
- You went through my e-mail !

517
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:54,606
All you wanted was to get
close to me

518
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:57,343
to sell a book about me
and the Ice-Truck Killer !

519
00:35:57,378 --> 00:36:00,045
- That's crazy. Those letters...
- Fuck you ! Fuck you !

520
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:37,449
What can I do you for ?

521
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,674
- Drink ?
- Beer. Whatever's on tap.

522
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:47,918
<i>Una fría, coming up.</i>

523
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:07,729
Way to ditch me.

524
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,241
<i>You were in the shower.</i>

525
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:10,962
So, are you there ?

526
00:37:11,501 --> 00:37:13,235
Do you see him ?

527
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:16,029
He's staring at me.

528
00:37:16,436 --> 00:37:17,948
You gonna say something ?

529
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,825
I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.

530
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:23,426
I should go.

531
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:26,957
Well, call me when you figure
it out. All right ?

532
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,922
Three bucks.

533
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:42,013
You had no right !

534
00:37:42,074 --> 00:37:45,197
He's an addict, Rita.
he is no good for you !

535
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,813
He's already got you smoking again.

536
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:56,611
You turned your back on me
and your grandchildren.

537
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:58,603
That was not my fault.

538
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:02,158
I tried to warn you about Paul,
but you ran away with him anyway.

539
00:38:03,804 --> 00:38:06,940
I wasn't running away with Paul.

540
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,499
I was running away from you.

541
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:13,651
Do you have any idea
how much it hurts me

542
00:38:13,686 --> 00:38:16,244
to see you make
the same mistakes again ?

543
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:22,512
I've had my fair share of mistakes.

544
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,182
And guess what --
you were right about Paul.

545
00:38:25,746 --> 00:38:27,760
He was a terrible man.

546
00:38:28,162 --> 00:38:31,469
But for the first time,
i feel safe and loved.

547
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:33,398
And that's because of Dexter.

548
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:37,485
I can't talk to you when
you're like this. I'm going to bed.

549
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,419
This is my life, mother.

550
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:44,910
If you can't be happy for me,
then maybe you shouldn't be here.

551
00:38:44,971 --> 00:38:47,744
If you want to abandon me
and the kids again, fine.

552
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:49,395
That's your choice.

553
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,285
But Dexter is not going anywhere.

554
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:12,057
Last call was 30 minutes ago.

555
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:19,528
You hear me ?

556
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:22,072
I need you to finish that up.

557
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,733
Sorry.

558
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:31,132
I'm avoiding going back
to my motel room.

559
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:33,940
I'm visiting from Miami.

560
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:36,419
You ever been there ?

561
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:40,632
I can't say that I have.

562
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:51,059
How long you lived in Naples ?

563
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:52,894
Oh, a few years now.

564
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,247
You like it ?

565
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:00,113
<i>All right, coño.</i>

566
00:40:00,454 --> 00:40:01,654
Go.

567
00:40:02,712 --> 00:40:04,447
Okay. This is gonna be awkward.

568
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:09,536
I need to tell you how I feel.

569
00:40:09,597 --> 00:40:12,502
No, what you need to do is leave

570
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:15,432
because you been eyeballing me
all night.

571
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,713
You really shouldn't do that.

572
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,132
I said get out of my bar.
- Okay.

573
00:40:22,907 --> 00:40:26,094
Just let me say
what I need to say, and I'll go.

574
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:32,483
You stole my life.

575
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:37,148
What the fuck ?
You are really beginning to piss me off.

576
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,775
I'm not the person I'm supposed to be
because you took someone from me.

577
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:45,179
I will beat your fucking head in

578
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:48,033
if you don't walk out that door
right now !

579
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,838
I tried Lila's way.

580
00:41:00,812 --> 00:41:02,394
1973 !

581
00:41:05,573 --> 00:41:07,010
The port of Miami !

582
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,863
A shipping container !

583
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:10,814
A chain saw !

584
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,283
Laura Moser !

585
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:17,961
You remember now ? You remember now ?

586
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:39,378
You got me confused with someone else !

587
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,942
I know exactly who you are !

588
00:41:44,286 --> 00:41:46,138
You made me into what I am !

589
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,035
Okay ! I-I killed her.

590
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,841
- I had to !
- Did you ? Did you have to ?

591
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:57,102
Did you have to saw her
into little pieces ?

592
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,845
Did you have to leave 2 little boys

593
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,592
soaking in a pool
of their mother's blood ?

594
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:04,408
Estrada would have killed me
if I didn't.

595
00:42:04,811 --> 00:42:09,571
You slaughtered her like an animal
because she stole his precious cocaine.

596
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:14,489
No. We found out she was
a snitch for a cop.

597
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:16,473
She was fucking him.

598
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:21,399
- Which cop ?
- I didn't know his name.

599
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:23,954
I followed them to a park.

600
00:42:24,573 --> 00:42:28,149
<i>My mother and Harry ?
That's what got her killed ?</i>

601
00:42:30,316 --> 00:42:32,324
I'm not done with you yet.

602
00:42:33,266 --> 00:42:36,564
<i>Isn't this what heroes do --
Avenge lost loved ones ?</i>

603
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:46,118
What ?

604
00:42:47,162 --> 00:42:48,612
Everything okay ?

605
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,544
Dexter, what's wrong ?

606
00:42:53,649 --> 00:42:55,118
I thought I could resist.

607
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,017
Jesus... are you using ?

608
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,326
No, but I'm about to.

609
00:43:02,261 --> 00:43:03,899
<i>Tell me where you are</i>

610
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:06,901
<i>and I'll get in a taxi
and I'll come get you.</i>

611
00:43:07,828 --> 00:43:09,341
I have to do this.

612
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:13,186
No, you don't !
Just tell me where you are.

613
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:20,986
- You'll be too late.
- Don't you bloody do this.

614
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:23,941
- You are stronger than that.
- I'm not !

615
00:43:24,283 --> 00:43:26,100
<i>Yes, you fucking are.</i>

616
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:28,797
<i>You've come this far.</i>

617
00:43:29,877 --> 00:43:31,668
If you turn back now,

618
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:34,599
you'll go right back
to the way you were...

619
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:36,044
<i>Hollow,</i>

620
00:43:36,776 --> 00:43:37,808
<i>angry,</i>

621
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:40,042
alone.

622
00:43:40,891 --> 00:43:43,441
<i>I will get you through this. I swear.</i>

623
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:46,332
Just come back to me. Okay ?

624
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:14,129
Are you all right ?

625
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:15,413
It's okay.

626
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:22,902
I didn't...

627
00:44:25,988 --> 00:44:27,438
It's okay.

628
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:29,599
I don't care what you did.

629
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:31,863
It's okay.

630
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:39,785
It's okay.

631
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,445
Baby.

632
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:45,224
It's okay.

633
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,957
What are you still doing here ?

634
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,395
Making sure our marina
surveillance is in place.

635
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,281
- You forget something ?
- I'm working up rental logs...

636
00:44:57,824 --> 00:44:59,527
on the other two marinas.

637
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,336
- You don't give up, do you ?
- Do you ?

638
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:07,011
I'm wide awake anyway.
Dexter's out of town.

639
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:09,211
I don't really sleep
when I'm by myself.

640
00:45:09,246 --> 00:45:11,191
What about the new boyfriend ?

641
00:45:12,814 --> 00:45:14,197
We sort of broke up.

642
00:45:17,224 --> 00:45:18,907
I broke up with him.

643
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:24,226
Guess you won't be needing this, then.

644
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:26,081
What's that ?

645
00:45:27,373 --> 00:45:28,806
Background check.

646
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,699
You said you were snooping.
Just thought I'd help.

647
00:45:32,734 --> 00:45:35,539
You ran a background check
on my boyfriend ?

648
00:45:37,774 --> 00:45:40,331
- What's it say ?
- Gabriel's clean.

649
00:45:41,164 --> 00:45:43,812
Well, except for those
parking tickets.

650
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,481
Just because he's not a criminal
doesn't mean he's not an asshole.

651
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:51,840
I went through his e-mail.

652
00:45:52,234 --> 00:45:54,594
I know, but it was worth it. I mean...

653
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:59,386
He was using me to shop around a book
about the ice-truck killer.

654
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,471
Do you know what kind of writer
Gabriel is ?

655
00:46:13,121 --> 00:46:14,679
Children's books ?

656
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:22,108
"The Ice Princess" is a children's book.

657
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:28,135
How could I be so fucking stupid ?

658
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:34,648
When my wife met me,
she was convinced I was a spy.

659
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:38,508
Connie didn't know it,
but she was actually right.

660
00:46:38,987 --> 00:46:40,677
You ran a background check on her ?

661
00:46:42,283 --> 00:46:43,483
No need.

662
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:45,004
Must be nice...

663
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:47,802
to just know like that.

664
00:46:50,729 --> 00:46:52,988
She died... two years ago.

665
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,069
Cancer.

666
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,068
I'm sorry.

667
00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:02,699
That's how I lost my mom.

668
00:47:08,878 --> 00:47:10,166
I should go.

669
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:13,827
Let me ask you something.

670
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:15,962
That boyfriend of yours,

671
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:19,063
Did he ever give you a reason
not to trust him ?

672
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:24,798
But I don't think it matters.

673
00:47:26,072 --> 00:47:28,277
I mean, I went insane on him.

674
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:30,618
He'll never forgive me.

675
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:32,964
Any broken bones involved ?

676
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:34,716
Facial contusions ?

677
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:39,554
You'll be fine.

678
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:21,156
Do you want to know
how I got into the program ?

679
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:31,504
I'd used for years.

680
00:48:32,513 --> 00:48:34,265
Binge, crash.

681
00:48:35,295 --> 00:48:37,592
Thought I had it under control.

682
00:48:39,228 --> 00:48:41,333
Then I met Marco.

683
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,940
What a shit.

684
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:51,209
Thought he was my boyfriend,
but he turned out to be my dealer.

685
00:48:56,437 --> 00:48:59,629
Bastard had me so strung out
by the time he left,

686
00:49:00,793 --> 00:49:02,420
nothing mattered.

687
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:06,409
Nothing was left...

688
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,259
but rage.

689
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:17,805
One night...

690
00:49:18,737 --> 00:49:20,719
I was so fucked up, God.

691
00:49:25,188 --> 00:49:28,561
I went to his house,
and I burned it to the ground.

692
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:36,853
What I didn't know was that
Marco was passed out inside.

693
00:49:45,007 --> 00:49:47,357
They blamed the fire on his drugs.

694
00:49:51,451 --> 00:49:52,885
But it was me.

695
00:49:56,947 --> 00:49:58,754
He died because of me.

696
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:07,576
That night, I went to my first meeting.

697
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,788
Seeing that side of myself
was terrifying.

698
00:50:17,034 --> 00:50:20,163
That I could possibly do that
to another person.

699
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:27,176
Did he deserve it ?

700
00:50:33,101 --> 00:50:34,301
Yes.

701
00:50:51,712 --> 00:50:53,763
Then you didn't do anything wrong.

702
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,724
Hey, you.

703
00:51:21,738 --> 00:51:23,909
I wasn't expecting you this early.

704
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:25,749
I didn't hit any traffic.

705
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:28,842
You're just in time for breakfast.

706
00:51:32,825 --> 00:51:34,130
Where's your mom ?

707
00:51:34,297 --> 00:51:37,213
Oh, I doubt she'll be joining us.

708
00:51:37,322 --> 00:51:39,766
She's been in her room all morning.

709
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,419
My guess is she's packing.

710
00:51:46,017 --> 00:51:47,625
Maybe I should go.

711
00:51:50,935 --> 00:51:54,140
No, you're staying right here
because you're a part of this family.

712
00:51:56,616 --> 00:51:59,316
Are you sure ?
I've put you through so much lately.

713
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:05,946
I'm here for you, Dexter...
No matter what.

714
00:52:10,057 --> 00:52:11,377
What's this ?

715
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:16,067
The patch.

716
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:19,310
I have some quitting of my own to do.

717
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:20,940
Sit.

718
00:52:26,117 --> 00:52:28,066
Is that anything important ?

719
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:33,061
Nope.

720
00:52:36,273 --> 00:52:37,473
Morning.

721
00:52:39,129 --> 00:52:40,329
Morning, Dexter.

722
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:42,676
Hi... Gail.

723
00:52:46,506 --> 00:52:49,921
So, Rita assures me that you are
committed to getting better.

724
00:52:53,393 --> 00:52:54,531
I am.

725
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,793
Then I wanna be here to help.

726
00:52:58,377 --> 00:53:01,365
In fact, I've decided to stay in Miami.

727
00:53:01,687 --> 00:53:05,867
I e-mailed the school board
my letter of resignation this morning.

728
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,399
What about your house ?

729
00:53:08,573 --> 00:53:10,233
I'll put it on the market.

730
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,407
Sweetie, I thought about
what you said last night.

731
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:16,656
I haven't been here for you,
and I want to change that.

732
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:23,716
My sister's looking for a new apartment.
I'm sure we can help you find one, too.

733
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,178
Well, don't be silly.
I'll be living here.

734
00:53:26,213 --> 00:53:29,651
Dexter, be a dear and pass me
the cream, please.

735
00:53:30,735 --> 00:53:31,975
Thank you.

736
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,105
<i>Harry taught me to lie</i>

737
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,446
<i>and keep my darkest secrets
from those around me...</i>

738
00:53:41,108 --> 00:53:43,869
<i>Which is why I need to make sure
there's not a trace of blood</i>

739
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:45,273
<i>left on my boat.</i>

740
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:49,285
<i>He also taught me
not to rush to judgment.</i>

741
00:53:49,988 --> 00:53:52,938
<i>Things aren't always
what they appear to be...</i>

742
00:53:54,485 --> 00:53:56,135
<i>including Harry.</i>

743
00:53:56,587 --> 00:53:58,137
<i>And what about me ?</i>

744
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:00,832
<i>Am I the twisted Bay Harbor Butcher...</i>

745
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,763
<i>Or the valiant Dark Defender ?</i>

746
00:54:04,735 --> 00:54:06,428
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

747
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:10,103
<i>Funny thing is I've met someone
who doesn't care what I am.</i>

748
00:54:11,744 --> 00:54:14,449
<i>I suppose every hero
needs a sidekick...</i>

749
00:54:14,934 --> 00:54:17,284
<i>Every villain, a partner in crime.</i>

750
00:54:20,271 --> 00:54:23,548
<i>All my relationships have been
built on not knowing.</i>

751
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:26,913
<i>But that may be changing.</i>

752
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:32,851
<i>Imagine that...</i>

753
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,055
<i>a life with no more secrets.</i>
